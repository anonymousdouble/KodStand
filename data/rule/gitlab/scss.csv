Utility Classes,Utility Classes,"note 
Please do not use any utilities that are prefixed with `gl-deprecated-` , instead use a Tailwind utility.
In order to reduce the generation of more CSS as our site grows, prefer the use of utility classes over adding new CSS. In complex cases, CSS can be addressed by adding component classes.",,

Building the Tailwind CSS bundle,Utility Classes/Tailwind CSS/Building the Tailwind CSS bundle,"When using Vite or Webpack with the GitLab Development Kit, Tailwind CSS watches for file changes to build detected utilities on the fly.
To build a fresh Tailwind CSS bundle, run `yarntailwindcss:build` . This is the script that gets called internally when building production assets with `bundleexecrakegitlab:assets:compile` .
However the bundle gets built, the output is saved to `app/assets/builds/tailwind.css` .",,
Where are utility classes defined?,Utility Classes/Tailwind CSS/Where are utility classes defined?,"Prefer the use of utility classes defined in GitLab UI .
An easy list of classes can also be seen on Unpkg .
Or using an extension like CSS Class completion .
Classes in utilities.scss and common.scss are being deprecated. Classes in common.scss that use non-design-system values should be avoided. Use classes with conforming values instead.
Avoid Bootstrap’s Utility Classes .
note 
While migrating Bootstrap’s Utility Classes to the GitLab UI utility classes, note both the classes for margin and padding differ. The size scale used at GitLab differs from the scale used in the Bootstrap library. For a Bootstrap padding or margin utility, you may need to double the size of the applied utility to achieve the same visual result (such as `ml-1` becoming `gl-ml-2` ).",,
Where should you put new utility classes?,Utility Classes/Tailwind CSS/Where should you put new utility classes?,"Because we are in the process of migrating to Tailwind the utility class you need may already be available from Tailwind. The IntelliSense for VS Code plugin will tell you what utility classes are available. If the utility class you need is not available from Tailwind, you should continue to use the utility classes defined in GitLab UI which can be seen on Unpkg . If the utility class is still not available we need to enable a new core plugin in Tailwind. Find the relevant core plugin and open a MR to add the core plugin to the `corePlugins` array in tailwind.defaults.js .",,
When should you create component classes?,Utility Classes/Tailwind CSS/When should you create component classes?,"We recommend a “utility-first” approach.
Start with utility classes. 
If composing utility classes into a component class removes code duplication and encapsulates a clear responsibility, do it.
This encourages an organic growth of component classes and prevents the creation of one-off non-reusable classes. Also, the kind of classes that emerge from “utility-first” tend to be design-centered (for example, `.button` , `.alert` , `.card` ) rather than domain-centered (for example, `.security-report-widget` , `.commit-header-icon` ).

Selectors with a js- Prefix,Selectors with a js- Prefix,Do not use any selector prefixed with `js-` for styling purposes. These selectors are intended for use only with JavaScript to allow for removal or renaming without breaking styling.,,
Using extend at-rule,Using extend at-rule,Usage of the `extend` at-rule is prohibited due to memory leaks and the rule doesn’t work as it should .,,
Linting,Linting,"We use stylelint to check for style guide conformity. It uses the ruleset in `.stylelintrc` and rules from our SCSS configuration . `.stylelintrc` is located in the home directory of the project.
To check if any warnings are produced by your changes, run `yarnlint:stylelint` in the GitLab directory. Stylelint also runs in GitLab CI/CD to catch any warnings.
If the Rake task is throwing warnings you don’t understand, SCSS Lint’s documentation includes a full list of their rules .",,
