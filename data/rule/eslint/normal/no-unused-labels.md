# no-unused-labels
## Overview
Disallow unused labels


âœ… Recommended

            The `"extends": "eslint:recommended"` property in a configuration file  enables this rule
        

ðŸ”§ Fixable

            Some problems reported by this rule are automatically fixable by the `--fix` command line  option
        


Labels that are declared and not used anywhere in the code are most likely an error due to incomplete refactoring.

```json
OUTER_LOOP:
for (const student of students) {
    if (checkScores(student.scores)) {
        continue;
    }
    doSomething(student);
}
```
In this case, probably removing `OUTER_LOOP:` had been forgotten.
Such labels take up space in the code and can lead to confusion by readers.
## Rule Details
This rule is aimed at eliminating unused labels.
Problems reported by this rule can be fixed automatically, except when there are any comments between the label and the following statement, or when removing a label would cause the following statement to become a directive such as `"use strict"`.
Examples of incorrect code for this rule:


```json
/*eslint no-unused-labels: "error"*/

A: var foo = 0;

B: {
    foo();
}

C:
for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    foo();
}
```
Examples of correct code for this rule:


```json
/*eslint no-unused-labels: "error"*/

A: {
    if (foo()) {
        break A;
    }
    bar();
}

B:
for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    if (foo()) {
        break B;
    }
    bar();
}
```
