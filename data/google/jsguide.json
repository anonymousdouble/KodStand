This block follows the `goog.module` declaration separated by a single empty line . The entire argument to `goog.require` or `goog.requireType` is a namespace defined by a `goog.module` in a separate file. `goog.require` and `goog.requireType` statements may not appear anywhere else in the file.\nEach `goog.require` or `goog.requireType` is assigned to a single constant alias, or else destructured into several constant aliases. These aliases are the only acceptable way to refer to dependencies in type annotations or code. Fully qualified namespaces must not be used anywhere, except as an argument to `goog.require` or `goog.requireType` .\nException : Types, variables, and functions declared in externs files have to use their fully qualified name in type annotations and code.\nAliases must match the final dot-separated component of the imported module's namespace.\nException : In certain cases, additional components of the namespace can be used to form a longer alias. The resulting alias must retain the original identifier's casing such that it still correctly identifies its type. Longer aliases may be used to disambiguate otherwise identical aliases, or if it significantly improves readability. In addition, a longer alias must be used to prevent masking native types such as `Element` , `Event` , `Error` , `Map` , and `Promise` (for a more complete list, see Standard Built-in Objects and Web\nAPIs at MDN). When renaming destructured aliases, a space must follow the colon as required in ?? .\nA file should not contain both a `goog.require` and a `goog.requireType` statement for the same namespace. If the imported name is used both in code and in type annotations, it should be imported by a single `goog.require` statement.\nIf a module is imported only for its side effects, the call must be a `goog.require` (not a `goog.requireType` ) and assignment may be omitted. A comment is required to explain why this is needed and suppress a compiler warning.\nThe lines are sorted according to the following rules: All requires with a name on the left hand side come first, sorted alphabetically by those names. Then destructuring requires, again sorted by the names on the left hand side. Finally, any require calls that are standalone (generally these are for modules imported just for their side effects).\nTip: There’s no need to memorize this order and enforce it manually. You can rely on your IDE to report requires that are not sorted correctly.\nIf a long alias or module name would cause a line to exceed the 80-column limit, it must not be wrapped: require lines are an exception to the 80-column limit.\nExample:",

Note that a word such as iOS is not really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply. \nNow lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of: \n… each word, to yield upper camel case, or \n… each word except the first, to yield lower camel case \nFinally, join all the words into a single identifier.\nNote that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded.\nExamples:\nProse form \nCorrect \nIncorrect \nXML HTTP request \nXmlHttpRequest \nXMLHTTPRequest \nnew customer ID \nnewCustomerId \nnewCustomerID \ninner stopwatch \ninnerStopwatch \ninnerStopWatch \nsupports IPv6 on iOS? \nsupportsIpv6OnIos \nsupportsIPv6OnIOS \nYouTube importer \nYouTubeImporter \nYoutubeImporter*\n*Acceptable, but not recommended.\nNote: Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for example nonempty and non-empty are both correct, so the method names checkNonempty and checkNonEmpty are likewise both correct."
