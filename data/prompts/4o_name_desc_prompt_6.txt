Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
3.2 Package statement
The package statement is not line-wrapped . The column limit (Section 4.4, Column limit: 100 ) does not apply to package statements.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
NoLineWrap
[Description]
Checks that chosen statements are not line-wrapped. By default, this
Check restricts wrapping import and package statements, but it's possible to check
any statement.
[Rule]
PackageDeclaration
[Description]
Ensures that a class has a package declaration, and (optionally) whether
the package name matches the directory name for the source file.


Rationale: Classes that live in the null package cannot be
imported. Many novice developers are not aware of this.


Packages provide logical namespace to classes and should be stored in
the form of directory levels to provide physical grouping to your classes.
These directories are added to the classpath so that your classes
are visible to JVM when it runs the code.
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Rule]
LineLength
[Description]
Checks for long lines.


Rationale: Long lines are hard to read in printouts or if developers
have limited screen space for the source code, e.g. if the IDE
displays additional information like project tree, class hierarchy,
etc.
[Rule]
ExecutableStatementCount
[Description]
Restricts the number of executable statements to a specified limit.
[Rule]
MultipleVariableDeclarations
[Description]
Checks that each variable declaration is in its own statement and on
its own line.


Rationale:

the Java code conventions chapter 6.1 recommends that
declarations should be one per line/statement.
[Rule]
PackageName
[Description]
Checks that package names conform to a specified pattern.


The default value of format for module PackageName has been
chosen to match the requirements in the
Java
Language specification and the Sun coding conventions. However,
both underscores and uppercase letters are rather uncommon, so most
configurations should probably assign value ^[a-z]+(\.[a-z][a-z0-9]*)*$ to
format for module PackageName.
[Rule]
PackageAnnotation
[Description]
Checks that all package annotations are in the package-info.java file.


For Java SE8 and above, placement of package annotations in the package-info.java
file is enforced by the compiler and this check is not necessary.


For Java SE7 and below, the Java Language Specification highly recommends
but doesn't require that annotations are placed in the package-info.java file,
and this check can help to enforce that placement.


See
Java Language Specification, ¡ì7.4.1 for more info.
[Rule]
RedundantImport
[Description]
Checks for redundant import statements. An import statement is
considered redundant if:



It is a duplicate of another import. This is, when a class is
imported more than once.


The class non-statically imported is from the java.lang
package, e.g. importing java.lang.String.


The class non-statically imported is from the same package as the current package.
[Rule]
EmptyStatement
[Description]
Detects empty statements (standalone ";" semicolon).
Empty statements often introduce bugs that are hard to spot

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
