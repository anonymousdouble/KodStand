This rule was deprecated in ESLint v8.53.0. Please use the corresponding rule  in @stylistic/eslint-plugin-js .
 markdownlint-disable-next-line MD051 
With ES6, itâ€™s possible to create functions called tagged template literals  where the function parameters consist of a template literalâ€™s strings and expressions.
When using tagged template literals, itâ€™s possible to insert whitespace between the tag function and the template literal. Since this whitespace is optional, the following lines are equivalent:

```json
let hello = func`Hello world`;
let hello = func `Hello world`;
```
## Rule Details
This rule aims to maintain consistency around the spacing between template tag functions and their template literals.
## Options

```json
{
    "template-tag-spacing": ["error", "never"]
}
```
This rule has one option whose value can be set to `"never"` or `"always"`

`"never"` (default) - Disallows spaces between a tag function and its template literal.
`"always"` - Requires one or more spaces between a tag function and its template literal.

## Examples
### never
Examples of incorrect code for this rule with the default `"never"` option:


```json
/*eslint template-tag-spacing: "error"*/

func `Hello world`;
```
Examples of correct code for this rule with the default `"never"` option:


```json
/*eslint template-tag-spacing: "error"*/

func`Hello world`;
```
### always
Examples of incorrect code for this rule with the `"always"` option:


```json
/*eslint template-tag-spacing: ["error", "always"]*/

func`Hello world`;
```
Examples of correct code for this rule with the `"always"` option:


```json
/*eslint template-tag-spacing: ["error", "always"]*/

func `Hello world`;
```
## When Not To Use It
If you donâ€™t want to be notified about usage of spacing between tag functions and their template literals, then itâ€™s safe to disable this rule.
## Version
