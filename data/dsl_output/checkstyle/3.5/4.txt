Analyze the following CheckStyle Rule, please parse the CheckStyle Rule using the given Grammar to make its semantics clear and correct. CheckStyle Rule consists of Description and configurable Options. 

1. Analyze whether each sentence of Description of CheckStyle Rule is a rule and then classify it as mandatory or optional. If the rule is same as an option, do not need to parse it as a rule. If the rule is subjective, do not classify it as a rule. 
2. Analyze whether each option is a rule. If option is a configurable term, using {{OptionName}} to represent the term. If the option is to configure violation messages or reporting granularity, do not classify it as a rule. If the option is a rule, parse rule for each value of the option.
3. When parsing a rule using the given Grammar, pay attention to map to suitable formal Java term and select appropriate real operator characters. 

CheckStyle Rule:
Rulename
MissingDeprecated
Description

Verifies that the annotation @Deprecated and the Javadoc tag
@deprecated are both present when either of them is present.


Both ways of flagging deprecation serve their own purpose.
The @Deprecated annotation is used for compilers and development tools.
The @deprecated javadoc tag is used to document why something is deprecated
and what, if any, alternatives exist.


In order to properly mark something as deprecated both forms of
deprecation should be present.


Package deprecation is an exception to the rule of always using the
javadoc tag and annotation to deprecate.  It is not clear if the
javadoc tool will support it or not as newer versions keep flip-flopping
on if it is supported or will cause an error.
See
JDK-8160601.
The deprecated javadoc tag is currently the only way to say why the package
is deprecated and what to use instead.  Until this is resolved, if you
don't want to print violations on package-info, you can use a
filter to ignore these files until
the javadoc tool faithfully supports it. An example config using
SuppressionSingleFilter is:

Grammar:
RuleSet ::= Rule1 [And|Or|; Rule2]* # And means should satisfy Rule1 and Rule2. Or means can satisfy Rule1 or Rule2. ; means Rule1,Rule2 belongs to diffent groups
Rule ::= {{'Optional'| 'Mandatory'}} [ ['Order' of | 'Number' of] TermList [Operator TermList]* | Rule1 '->' Rule2] [ExceptionRule] #'Order' of  means order rule, 'Number' of means numberConstraint, Rule1 '->' Rule2 means if Rule1 then Rule2
ExceptionRule ::= 'Except ' TermList | Rule # means rules not applied to TermList | Rule # means rules not applied to TermList | Rule
Operator = 'is'| 'is not' | '>=' | '<=' | '=' | '!=' | 'for' | 'not for' | 'before' | 'not before' | 'after' | 'not after' | 'between' | 'not between' | 'have' | 'not have' | 'Add' | 'Sub' | 'Mult' | MatMult | 'Div' | 'Mod' | 'Pow' | 'LShift' | 'RShift' | 'BitOr' | 'BitXor' | 'BitAnd' | 'FloorDiv'
TermList ::= Term [, Term]*
Modifier ::= 'some' | 'each' | 'all' | 'except' | 'first' | 'last' | ...
Term :: = JavaTerm | Modifier* Term | Term of Term
JavaTerm means the formal expression using such format [XXX] "XXX" represent a JavaTerm
