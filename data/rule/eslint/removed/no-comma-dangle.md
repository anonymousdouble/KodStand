# no-comma-dangle
## Overview

Disallows trailing commas in object and array literals.

Trailing commas in object literals are valid according to the ECMAScript 5 (and ECMAScript 3!) spec, however IE8 (when not in IE8 document mode) and below will throw an error when it encounters trailing commas in JavaScript.


```json
var foo = {
    bar: "baz",
    qux: "quux",
};
```

## Rule Details

This rule is aimed at detecting trailing commas in object literals. As such, it will warn whenever it encounters a trailing comma in an object literal.

Examples of incorrect code for this rule:


```json
var foo = {
    bar: "baz",
    qux: "quux",
};

var arr = [1,2,];

foo({
  bar: "baz",
  qux: "quux",
});
```

Examples of correct code for this rule:


```json
var foo = {
    bar: "baz",
    qux: "quux"
};

var arr = [1,2];

foo({
  bar: "baz",
  qux: "quux"
});
```

## When Not To Use It

If your code will not be run in IE8 or below (a Node.js application, for example) and youâ€™d prefer to allow trailing commas, turn this rule off.

## Version

This rule was introduced in ESLint v0.0.9
                 and removed in v1.0.0-rc-1.
