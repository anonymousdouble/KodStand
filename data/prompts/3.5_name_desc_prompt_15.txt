Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.1.2 Nonempty blocks: K & R style
Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style (" Egyptian brackets ") for nonempty blocks and block-like constructs:
 No line break before the opening brace, except as detailed below. 
 Line break after the opening brace. 
 Line break before the closing brace. 
 Line break after the closing brace, only if that brace terminates a statement or terminates the body of a method, constructor, or named class. For example, there is no line break after the brace if it is followed by `else` or a comma.
 Exception: In places where these rules allow a single statement ending with a semicolon ( `;` ), a block of statements can appear, and the opening brace of this block is preceded by a line break. Blocks like these are typically introduced to limit the scope of local variables, for example inside switch statements.
 Examples:
 return () -> {
  while (condition()) {
  method();
  }
 };
 

 return new MyClass() {
  @Override public void method() {
  if (condition()) {
  try {
  something();
  } catch (ProblemException e) {
  recover();
  }
  } else if (otherCondition()) {
  somethingElse();
  } else {
  lastThing();
  }
  {
  int x = foo();
  frob(x);
  }
  }
 };
 

 A few exceptions for enum classes are given in Section 4.8.1, Enum classes .

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
RightCurly
[Description]
Checks the placement of right curly braces ('}') for code blocks.
This check supports if-else, try-catch-finally blocks, switch statements, switch cases,
while-loops, for-loops, method definitions, class definitions, constructor definitions,
instance, static initialization blocks, annotation definitions and enum definitions.
For right curly brace of expression blocks of arrays, lambdas and class instances
please follow issue
#5945.
For right curly brace of enum constant please follow issue
#7519.
[Rule]
AvoidNestedBlocks
[Description]
Finds nested blocks (blocks that are used freely in the code).


Rationale: Nested blocks are often leftovers from the
debugging process, they confuse the reader.


For example, this check finds the obsolete braces in



public void guessTheOutput()
{
int whichIsWhich = 0;
{
whichIsWhich = 2;
}
System.out.println("value = " + whichIsWhich);
}

and debugging / refactoring leftovers such as


// if (conditionThatIsNotUsedAnyLonger)
{
System.out.println("unconditional");
}


A case in a switch statement does not implicitly form a block.
Thus, to be able to introduce local variables that have case
scope it is necessary to open a nested block. This is
supported, set the allowInSwitchCase property to true and
include all statements of the case in the block.
[Rule]
NeedBraces
[Description]
Checks for braces around code blocks.
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Rule]
EmptyBlock
[Description]
Checks for empty blocks. This check does not validate sequential blocks.
Sequential blocks won't be checked. Also, no violations for fallthrough:


switch (a) {
case 1:                          // no violation
case 2:                          // no violation
case 3: someMethod(); { }        // no violation
default: break;
}


NOTE: This check processes LITERAL_CASE and LITERAL_DEFAULT separately.
Verification empty block is done for single nearest {@code case} or {@code default}.
[Rule]
WhitespaceAround
[Description]
Checks that a token is surrounded by whitespace. Empty constructor,
method, class, enum, interface, loop bodies (blocks), lambdas of the form


public MyClass() {}      // empty constructor
public void func() {}    // empty method
public interface Foo {} // empty interface
public class Foo {} // empty class
public enum Foo {} // empty enum
MyClass c = new MyClass() {}; // empty anonymous class
while (i = 1) {} // empty while loop
for (int i = 1; i > 1; i++) {} // empty for loop
do {} while (i = 1); // empty do-while loop
Runnable noop = () -> {}; // empty lambda
public @interface Beta {} // empty annotation type


may optionally be exempted from the policy using the
allowEmptyMethods, allowEmptyConstructors,
allowEmptyTypes, allowEmptyLoops,
allowEmptyLambdas and allowEmptyCatches
properties.

This check does not flag as violation double brace initialization like:



new Properties() {{
setProperty("key", "value");
}};


Parameter allowEmptyCatches allows to suppress violations when token
list contains SLIST to check if beginning of block is surrounded by
whitespace and catch block is empty, for example:



try {
k = 5 / i;
} catch (ArithmeticException ex) {}



With this property turned off, this raises violation because the beginning of the
catch block (left curly bracket) is not separated from the end of the catch
block (right curly bracket).
[Rule]
AvoidDoubleBraceInitialization
[Description]
Detects double brace initialization.


Rationale: Double brace initialization (set of

Instance Initializers in class body) may look cool,
but it is considered as anti-pattern and should be avoided.
This is also can lead to a hard-to-detect memory leak, if the anonymous class instance is
returned outside and other object(s) hold reference to it.
Created anonymous class is not static, it holds an implicit reference to the outer class
instance.
See this

blog post and

article for more details.
Check ignores any comments and semicolons in class body.
[Rule]
LeftCurly
[Description]
Checks for the placement of left curly braces
('{') for code blocks.
[Rule]
EmptyStatement
[Description]
Detects empty statements (standalone ";" semicolon).
Empty statements often introduce bugs that are hard to spot

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
