Avoid ActiveRecord callbacks,Avoid ActiveRecord callbacks,"ActiveRecord callbacks allow you to “trigger logic before or after an alteration of an object’s state.”
Use callbacks when no superior alternative exists, but employ them only if you thoroughly understand the reasons for doing so.
When adding new lifecycle events for ActiveRecord objects, it is preferable to add the logic to a service class instead of a callback.",,
Why callbacks should be avoided,Why callbacks should be avoided,"In general, callbacks should be avoided because:
Callbacks are hard to reason about because invocation order is not obvious and they break code narrative. 
Callbacks are harder to locate and navigate because they rely on reflection to trigger rather than being ordinary method calls. 
Callbacks make it difficult to apply changes selectively to an object’s state because changes always trigger the entire callback chain. 
Callbacks trap logic in the ActiveRecord class. This tight coupling encourages fat models that contain too much business logic, which could instead live in service objects that are more reusable, composable, and are easier to test. 
Illegal state transitions of an object can be better enforced through attribute validations. 
Heavy use of callbacks affects factory creation speed. With some classes having hundreds of callbacks, creating an instance of that object for an automated test can be a very slow operation, resulting in slow specs.
Some of these examples are discussed in this video from thoughtbot .
The GitLab codebase relies heavily on callbacks and it is hard to refactor them once added due to invisible dependencies. As a result, this guideline does not call for removing all existing callbacks.",,
When to use callbacks,Why callbacks should be avoided/When to use callbacks,"Callbacks can be used in special cases. Some examples of cases where adding a callback makes sense:
A dependency uses callbacks and we would like to override the callback behavior. 
Incrementing cache counts. 
Data normalization that only relates to data on the current model.",,
Example of moving from a callback to a service,Why callbacks should be avoided/Example of moving from a callback to a service,There is a project with the following basic data model:,"class Project
  has_one :repository

end
",
Example of moving from a callback to a service,Why callbacks should be avoided/Example of moving from a callback to a service,Say we want to create a repository after a project is created and use the project name as the repository name. A developer familiar with Rails might immediately think: sounds like a job for an ActiveRecord callback! And add this code:,"class Project
  has_one :repository

  after_initialize :create_random_name
  after_create :create_repository

  def create_random_name
    SecureRandom.alphanumeric
  end

  def create_repository
    Repository.create!(project: self)
  end
end

class Repository
  after_initialize :set_name

  def set_name
    name = project.name
  end
end

class ProjectsController
  def create
    Project.create! # also creates a repository and names it
  end
end
",
Example of moving from a callback to a service,Why callbacks should be avoided/Example of moving from a callback to a service,"While this seems pretty harmless for a baby Rails app, adding this type of logic via callbacks has many downsides once your Rails app becomes large and complex (all of which are listed in this documentation). Instead, we can add this logic to a service class:","class Project
  has_one :repository
end

class Repository
  belongs_to :project
end

class ProjectCreator
  def self.execute
    ApplicationRecord.transaction do
      name = SecureRandom.alphanumeric
      project = Project.create!(name: name)
      Repository.create!(project: project, name: name)
    end
  end
end

class ProjectsController
  def create
    ProjectCreator.execute
  end
end
","With an application this simple, it can be hard to see the benefits of the second approach. But we already some benefits:
Can test `Repository` creation logic separate from `Project` creation logic. Code no longer violates law of demeter ( `Repository` class doesn’t need to know `project.name` ). 
Clarity of invocation order. 
Open to change: if we decide there are some scenarios where we do not want a repository created for a project, we can create a new service class rather than needing to refactor to `Project` and `Repository` classes. 
Each instance of a `Project` factory does not create a second ( `Repository` ) object."

Functional patterns,Styles we have no opinion on/Functional patterns,"Although Ruby and especially Rails are primarily based on object-oriented programming patterns, Ruby is a very flexible language and supports functional programming patterns as well.
Functional programming patterns, especially in domain logic, can often result in more readable, maintainable, and bug-resistant code while still using idiomatic and familiar Ruby patterns. However, functional programming patterns should be used carefully because some patterns would cause confusion and should be avoided even if they’re directly supported by Ruby. The curry
 
 method is a likely example.
