This rule was deprecated in ESLint v8.53.0. Please use the corresponding rule  in @stylistic/eslint-plugin-js .
Typing mistakes and misunderstandings about where semicolons are required can lead to semicolons that are unnecessary. While not technically an error, extra semicolons can cause confusion when reading code.
## Rule Details
This rule disallows unnecessary semicolons.
Problems reported by this rule can be fixed automatically, except when removing a semicolon would cause a following statement to become a directive such as `"use strict"`.
Examples of incorrect code for this rule:

    // code

    method() {
        // code
    };

    static {
        // code
    };
