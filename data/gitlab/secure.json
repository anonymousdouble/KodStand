It is a powerful tool, but can be dangerous if we allow untrusted actors (like users) to define their own arbitrary methods. For example, imagine we accidentally let an attacker overwrite an access control method to always return true! It can lead to many classes of vulnerabilities such as access control bypass, information disclosure, arbitrary file reads, and remote code execution.\nKey methods to watch out for are `method_missing` , `define_method` , `delegate` , and similar methods."

An attacker updates the DNS record to `127.0.0.1` , and when your code resolves those URL host it results in sending a potentially malicious request to a server on the internal network. The property was valid at the “time of check”, but invalid and malicious at “time of use”.\nGitLab-specific example can be found in this issue where, although `Gitlab::HTTP_V2::UrlBlocker.validate!` was called, the returned value was not used. This made it vulnerable to TOCTOU bug and SSRF protection bypass through DNS rebinding . The fix was to use the validated IP address .\nExample 2: you have a feature which schedules jobs. When the user schedules the job, they have permission to do so. But imagine if, between the time they schedule the job and the time it is run, their permissions are restricted. Unless you re-check permissions at time of use, you could inadvertently allow unauthorized activity.\nExample 3: you need to fetch a remote file, and perform a `HEAD` request to get and validate the content length and content type. When you subsequently make a `GET` request, though, the file delivered is a different size or different file type.

The server is multi-threaded, and you aren’t using transactions or an applicable database index. By repeatedly selecting upvote in quick succession a malicious user is able to add multiple upvotes: the requests arrive at the same time, the checks run in parallel and confirm that no upvote exists yet, and so each upvote is written to the database.\nHere’s some pseudocode showing an example of a potential TOCTOU bug:",

For instance, store the keys in a vault, KMS, or file. Here is an example use of `attr_encrypted` for encryption with keys stored in separate access controlled file. When the intention is to only compare secrets, store only the salted hash of the secret instead of the encrypted value. \nSalted hashes should be used to store any sensitive value where the plaintext value itself does not need to be retrieved. Never commit credentials to repositories. \nThe Gitleaks Git hook is recommended for preventing credentials from being committed. \nNever log credentials under any circumstance. Issue #353857 is an example of credential leaks through log file. When credentials are required in a CI/CD job, use masked variables to help prevent accidental exposure in the job logs. Be aware that when debug logging is enabled, all masked CI/CD variables are visible in job logs. Also consider using protected variables when possible so that sensitive CI/CD variables are only available to pipelines running on protected branches or protected tags. Proper scanners must be enabled depending on what data those credentials are protecting. See the Application Security Inventory Policy and our Data Classification Standards . To store and/or share credentials between teams, refer to 1Password for Teams and follow the 1Password Guidelines . If you need to share a secret with a team member, use 1Password.
