# comma-spacing
## Overview

Enforce consistent spacing before and after commas

This rule was deprecated in ESLint v8.53.0. Please use the corresponding rule  in @stylistic/eslint-plugin-js .

Spacing around commas improves readability of a list of items. Although most of the style guidelines for languages prescribe adding a space after a comma and not before it, it is subjective to the preferences of a project.


```json
var foo = 1, bar = 2;
var foo = 1 ,bar = 2;
```

## Rule Details

This rule enforces consistent spacing before and after commas in variable declarations, array literals, object literals, function parameters, and sequences.

This rule does not apply in either of the following cases:


- between two commas

- between opening bracket `[` and comma, to avoid conflicts with the array-bracket-spacing  rule

- between comma and closing bracket `]`, to avoid conflicts with the array-bracket-spacing  rule

- between comma and closing brace `}`, to avoid conflicts with the object-curly-spacing  rule

- between comma and closing parentheses `)`, to avoid conflicts with the space-in-parens  rule

## Options

This rule has an object option:


- `"before": false` (default) disallows spaces before commas

- `"before": true` requires one or more spaces before commas

- `"after": true` (default) requires one or more spaces after commas

- `"after": false` disallows spaces after commas

### after

Examples of incorrect code for this rule with the default `{ "before": false, "after": true }` options:


```json
/*eslint comma-spacing: ["error", { "before": false, "after": true }]*/

var foo = 1 ,bar = 2;
var arr = [1 , 2];
var obj = {"foo": "bar" ,"baz": "qur"};
foo(a ,b);
new Foo(a ,b);
function baz(a ,b){}
a ,b
```

Examples of correct code for this rule with the default `{ "before": false, "after": true }` options:


```json
/*eslint comma-spacing: ["error", { "before": false, "after": true }]*/

var foo = 1, bar = 2
    , baz = 3;
var arr = [1, 2];
var arr = [1,, 3]
var obj = {"foo": "bar", "baz": "qur"};
foo(a, b);
new Foo(a, b);
function qur(a, b){}
a, b
```

Additional examples of correct code for this rule with the default `{ "before": false, "after": true }` options:


```json
/*eslint comma-spacing: ["error", { "before": false, "after": true }]*/

// this rule does not enforce spacing between two commas
var arr = [
    ,,
    , ,
];

// this rule does not enforce spacing after `[` and before `]`
var arr = [,];
var arr = [ , ];
var arr = [a, b,];
[,] = arr;
[ , ] = arr;
[a, b,] = arr;

// this rule does not enforce spacing before `}`
var obj = {x, y,};
var {z, q,} = obj;
import {foo, bar,} from "mod";

// this rule does not enforce spacing before `)`
foo(a, b,)
```

### before

Examples of incorrect code for this rule with the `{ "before": true, "after": false }` options:


```json
/*eslint comma-spacing: ["error", { "before": true, "after": false }]*/

var foo = 1, bar = 2;
var arr = [1 , 2];
var obj = {"foo": "bar", "baz": "qur"};
new Foo(a,b);
function baz(a,b){}
a, b
```

Examples of correct code for this rule with the `{ "before": true, "after": false }` options:


```json
/*eslint comma-spacing: ["error", { "before": true, "after": false }]*/

var foo = 1 ,bar = 2 ,
    baz = true;
var arr = [1 ,2];
var arr = [1 ,,3]
var obj = {"foo": "bar" ,"baz": "qur"};
foo(a ,b);
new Foo(a ,b);
function qur(a ,b){}
a ,b
```
