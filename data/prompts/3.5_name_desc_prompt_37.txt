Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
5.2.4 Constant names
Constant names use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` : all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore. But what is a constant, exactly?
 Constants are static final fields whose contents are deeply immutable and whose methods have no detectable side effects. Examples include primitives, strings, immutable value classes, and anything set to `null` . If any of the instance's observable state can change, it is not a constant. Merely intending to never mutate the object is not enough. Examples:
 // Constants
 static final int NUMBER = 5;
 static final ImmutableList<String> NAMES = ImmutableList.of("Ed", "Ann");
 static final Map<String, Integer> AGES = ImmutableMap.of("Ed", 35, "Ann", 32);
 static final Joiner COMMA_JOINER = Joiner.on(','); // because Joiner is immutable
 static final SomeMutableType[] EMPTY_ARRAY = {};
 

 // Not constants
 static String nonFinal = "non-final";
 final String nonStatic = "non-static";
 static final Set<String> mutableCollection = new HashSet<String>();
 static final ImmutableSet<SomeMutableType> mutableElements = ImmutableSet.of(mutable);
 static final ImmutableMap<String, SomeMutableType> mutableValues =
  ImmutableMap.of("Ed", mutableInstance, "Ann", mutableInstance2);
 static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.getName());
 static final String[] nonEmptyArray = {"these", "can", "change"};
 

 These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
ConstantName
[Description]
Checks that constant names conform to a specified pattern.
A constant is a static and final field or an
interface/annotation field, except serialVersionUID and
serialPersistentFields.
[Rule]
MagicNumber
[Description]
Checks that there are no

"magic numbers" where a magic
number is a numeric literal that is not defined as a constant.
By default, -1, 0, 1, and 2 are not considered to be magic numbers.


Constant definition is any variable/field that has 'final' modifier.
It is fine to have one constant defining multiple numeric literals within one expression:



static final int SECONDS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60;
static final double SPECIAL_RATIO = 4.0 / 3.0;
static final double SPECIAL_SUM = 1 + Math.E;
static final double SPECIAL_DIFFERENCE = 4 - Math.PI;
static final Border STANDARD_BORDER = BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(3, 3, 3, 3);
static final Integer ANSWER_TO_THE_ULTIMATE_QUESTION_OF_LIFE = new Integer(42);
[Rule]
VisibilityModifier
[Description]
Checks visibility of class members. Only static final, immutable or annotated
by specified annotation members may be public; other class members must be private
unless the property protectedAllowed or packageAllowed is set.


Public members are not flagged if the name matches the public
member regular expression (contains "^serialVersionUID$" by default).

Note that
Checkstyle 2 used to include "^f[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$" in the default
pattern to allow names used in container-managed persistence for Enterprise JavaBeans
(EJB) 1.1 with the default settings. With EJB 2.0 it is no longer necessary to have
public access for persistent fields, so the default has been changed.


Rationale: Enforce encapsulation.


Check also has options making it less strict:


ignoreAnnotationCanonicalNames - the list of annotations which ignore variables
in consideration. If user want to provide short annotation name that type
will match to any named the same type without consideration of package.


allowPublicFinalFields - which allows public final fields.


allowPublicImmutableFields - which allows immutable fields to be declared as
public if defined in final class.


Field is known to be immutable if:


It's declared as final

Has either a primitive type or instance of class user defined to be immutable
(such as String, ImmutableCollection from Guava, etc.)



Classes known to be immutable are listed in immutableClassCanonicalNames by their
canonical names.


Property Rationale: Forcing all fields of class to have private modifier by default is
good in most cases, but in some cases it drawbacks in too much boilerplate get/set code.
One of such cases are immutable classes.


Restriction: Check doesn't check if class is immutable, there's no
checking if accessory methods are missing and all fields are immutable, we only check
if current field is immutable or final. Under the flag
allowPublicImmutableFields, the enclosing class must also be final, to encourage
immutability. Under the flag allowPublicFinalFields, the final modifier on
the enclosing class is optional.


Star imports are out of scope of this Check. So if one of type imported via
star import collides with user specified one by its short name -
there won't be Check's violation.
[Rule]
StaticVariableName
[Description]
Checks that static, non-final variable names
conform to a specified pattern.
[Rule]
AbbreviationAsWordInName
[Description]
Validates abbreviations (consecutive capital letters) length in identifier name,
it also allows to enforce camel case naming. Please read more at

Google Style Guide
to get to know how to avoid long abbreviations in names.

'_' is considered as word separator in identifier name.

allowedAbbreviationLength specifies how many consecutive capital letters are
allowed in the identifier.
A value of 3 indicates that up to 4 consecutive capital letters are allowed,
one after the other, before a violation is printed. The identifier 'MyTEST' would be
allowed, but 'MyTESTS' would not be.
A value of 0 indicates that only 1 consecutive capital letter is allowed. This
is what should be used to enforce strict camel casing. The identifier 'MyTest' would
be allowed, but 'MyTEst' would not be.


ignoreFinal, ignoreStatic, and ignoreStaticFinal
control whether variables with the respective modifiers are to be ignored.
Note that a variable that is both static and final will always be considered under
ignoreStaticFinal only, regardless of the values of ignoreFinal
and ignoreStatic. So for example if ignoreStatic is true but
ignoreStaticFinal is false, then static final variables will not be ignored.
[Rule]
HideUtilityClassConstructor
[Description]
Makes sure that utility classes (classes that contain only static
methods or fields in their API) do not have a public constructor.


Rationale: Instantiating utility classes does not make sense. Hence,
the constructors should either be private or (if you want to allow
subclassing) protected. A common mistake is forgetting to hide the
default constructor.


If you make the constructor protected you may want to consider the
following constructor implementation technique to disallow
instantiating subclasses:



public class StringUtils // not final to allow subclassing
{
protected StringUtils() {
// prevents calls from subclass
throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

public static int count(char c, String s) {
// ...
}
}
[Rule]
FinalClass
[Description]
Ensures that identifies classes that can be effectively declared as final are explicitly
marked as final. The following are different types of classes that can be identified:



Private classes with no declared constructors.


Classes with any modifier, and contains only private constructors.



Classes are skipped if:



Class is Super class of some Anonymous inner class.


Class is extended by another class in the same file.
[Rule]
MutableException
[Description]
Ensures that exception classes (classes with names conforming to some pattern
and explicitly extending classes with names conforming to other
pattern) are immutable, that is, that they have only final fields.


The current algorithm is very simple: it checks that all members of
exception are final. The user can still mutate an exception's instance
(e.g. Throwable has a method called setStackTrace
which changes the exception's stack trace). But, at least, all information
provided by this exception type is unchangeable.


Rationale: Exception instances should represent an error
condition. Having non-final fields not only allows the state to be
modified by accident and therefore mask the original condition but
also allows developers to accidentally forget to set the initial state.
In both cases, code catching the exception could draw incorrect
conclusions based on the state.
[Rule]
RedundantModifier
[Description]
Checks for redundant modifiers.


Rationale: The Java Language Specification strongly
discourages the usage of public and abstract for method
declarations in interface definitions as a matter of style.

The check validates:

Interface and annotation definitions.
Final modifier on methods of final and anonymous classes.

Type declarations nested under interfaces that are declared as public
or static.

Class constructors.

Nested enum definitions that are declared
as static.


record definitions that are declared as final and nested
record definitions that are declared as static.



interfaces by definition are abstract so the abstract modifier is
redundant on them.


Type declarations nested under interfaces by definition are public and static,
so the public and static modifiers on nested type
declarations are redundant. On the other hand, classes inside of interfaces can
be abstract or non abstract. So, abstract modifier is allowed.


Fields in interfaces and annotations are automatically
public, static and final, so these modifiers are redundant as
well.


As annotations are a form of interface, their fields are also
automatically public, static and final just as their
annotation fields are automatically public and abstract.


A record class is implicitly final and cannot be abstract, these restrictions emphasize
that the API of a record class is defined solely by its state description, and cannot be
enhanced later by another class. Nested records are implicitly static. This avoids an
immediately enclosing instance which would silently add state to the record class.
See JEP 395 for more info.


Enums by definition are static implicit subclasses of java.lang.Enum<E>.
So, the static modifier on the enums is redundant. In addition,
if enum is inside of interface, public modifier is also redundant.


Enums can also contain abstract methods and methods which can be overridden by the
declared enumeration fields.
See the following example:



public enum EnumClass {
FIELD_1,
FIELD_2 {
@Override
public final void method1() {} // violation expected
};

public void method1() {}
public final void method2() {} // no violation expected
}


Since these methods can be overridden in these situations, the final methods are not
marked as redundant even though they can't be extended by other classes/enums.


Nested enum types are always static by default.


Final classes by definition cannot be extended so the final
modifier on the method of a final class is redundant.


Public modifier for constructors in non-public non-protected classes
is always obsolete:



public class PublicClass {
public PublicClass() {} // OK
}

class PackagePrivateClass {
public PackagePrivateClass() {} // violation expected
}

There is no violation in the following example,
because removing public modifier from ProtectedInnerClass
constructor will make this code not compiling:



package a;
public class ClassExample {
protected class ProtectedInnerClass {
public ProtectedInnerClass () {}
}
}

package b;
import a.ClassExample;
public class ClassExtending extends ClassExample {
ProtectedInnerClass pc = new ProtectedInnerClass();
}
[Rule]
ModifierOrder
[Description]
Checks that the order of modifiers conforms to the suggestions in
the Java
Language specification, ¡ì 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3 and

9.4. The correct order is:



public


protected


private


abstract


default


static


sealed


non-sealed


final


transient


volatile


synchronized


native


strictfp



In additional, modifiers are checked to ensure all annotations are
declared before all other modifiers.


Rationale: Code is easier to read if everybody follows a standard.


ATTENTION: We skip

type annotations from validation.
