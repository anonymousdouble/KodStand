Description,Permissions/Description,"Application permissions are used to determine who can access what and what actions they can perform. For more information about the permission model at GitLab, see the GitLab permissions guide or the user docs on permissions .",,
Impact,Permissions/Impact,"Improper permission handling can have significant impacts on the security of an application. Some situations may reveal sensitive data or allow a malicious actor to perform harmful actions . The overall impact depends heavily on what resources can be accessed or modified improperly.
A common vulnerability when permission checks are missing is called IDOR for Insecure Direct Object References.",,
When to Consider,Permissions/When to Consider,"Each time you implement a new feature/endpoint, whether it is at UI, API or GraphQL level.",,
Mitigations,Permissions/Mitigations,"Start by writing tests around permissions: unit and feature specs should both include tests based around permissions
Fine-grained, nitty-gritty specs for permissions are good: it is ok to be verbose here 
Make assertions based on the actors and objects involved: can a user or group or XYZ perform this action on this object? 
Consider defining them upfront with stakeholders, particularly for the edge cases 
Do not forget abuse cases : write specs that make sure certain things can’t happen 
A lot of specs are making sure things do happen and coverage percentage doesn’t take into account permissions as same piece of code is used. 
Make assertions that certain actors cannot perform actions 
Naming convention to ease auditability: to be defined, for example, a subfolder containing those specific permission tests or a `#permissions` block
Be careful to also test visibility levels 
and not only project access rights.
The HTTP status code returned when an authorization check fails should generally be `404NotFound` to avoid revealing information about whether or not the requested resource exists. `403Forbidden` may be appropriate if you need to display a specific message to the user about why they cannot access the resource. If you are displaying a generic message such as “access denied”, consider returning `404NotFound` instead.

Anchors / Multi line,Regular Expressions guidelines/Anchors / Multi line,"Unlike other programming languages (for example, Perl or Python) Regular Expressions are matching multi-line by default in Ruby. Consider the following example in Python:","import re
text = ""foo\nbar""
matches = re.findall(""^bar$"",text)
print(matches)
",
Anchors / Multi line,Regular Expressions guidelines/Anchors / Multi line,The Python example will output an empty array ( `[]` ) as the matcher considers the whole string `foo\nbar` including the newline ( `\n` ). In contrast Ruby’s Regular Expression engine acts differently:,"text = ""foo\nbar""
p text.match /^bar$/
","The output of this example is `#<MatchData""bar"">` , as Ruby treats the input `text` line by line. To match the whole string , the Regex anchors `\A` and `\z` should be used."
Impact,Regular Expressions guidelines/Anchors / Multi line/Impact,"This Ruby Regex specialty can have security impact, as often regular expressions are used for validations or to impose restrictions on user-input.",,
Examples,Regular Expressions guidelines/Anchors / Multi line/Examples,"GitLab-specific examples can be found in the following path traversal and open redirect issues.
Another example would be this fictional Ruby on Rails controller:","class PingController < ApplicationController
  def ping
    if params[:ip] =~ /^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$/
      render :text => `ping -c 4 #{params[:ip]}`
    else
      render :text => ""Invalid IP""
    end

end
",Here `params[:ip]` should not contain anything else but numbers and dots. However this restriction can be easily bypassed as the Regex anchors `^` and `$` are being used. Ultimately this leads to a shell command injection in `ping-c4#{params[:ip]}` by using newlines in `params[:ip]` .
Mitigation,Regular Expressions guidelines/Anchors / Multi line/Mitigation,In most cases the anchors `\A` for beginning of text and `\z` for end of text should be used instead of `^` and `$` .,,
Denial of Service (ReDoS) / Catastrophic Backtracking,Denial of Service (ReDoS) / Catastrophic Backtracking,"When a regular expression (regex) is used to search for a string and can’t find a match, it may then backtrack to try other possibilities.
For example when the regex `.*!$` matches the string `hello!` , the `.*` first matches the entire string but then the `!` from the regex is unable to match because the character has already been used. In that case, the Ruby regex engine backtracks one character to allow the `!` to match.
ReDoS is an attack in which the attacker knows or controls the regular expression used. The attacker may be able to enter user input that triggers this backtracking behavior in a way that increases execution time by several orders of magnitude.",,
Impact,Denial of Service (ReDoS) / Catastrophic Backtracking/Impact,"The resource, for example Puma, or Sidekiq, can be made to hang as it takes a long time to evaluate the bad regex match. The evaluation time may require manual termination of the resource.",,
Examples,Denial of Service (ReDoS) / Catastrophic Backtracking/Examples,"Here are some GitLab-specific examples.
User inputs used to create regular expressions:
User-controlled filename 
User-controlled domain name 
User-controlled email address

Ruby,Denial of Service (ReDoS) / Catastrophic Backtracking/Mitigation/Ruby,"GitLab has Gitlab::UntrustedRegexp which internally uses the re2 library. `re2` does not support backtracking so we get constant execution time, and a smaller subset of available regex features.
All user-provided regular expressions should use `Gitlab::UntrustedRegexp` .
For other regular expressions, here are a few guidelines:
If there’s a clean non-regex solution, such as `String#start_with?` , consider using it 
Ruby supports some advanced regex features like atomic groups and possessive quantifiers that eliminate backtracking 
Avoid nested quantifiers if possible (for example `(a+)+` ) 
Try to be as precise as possible in your regex and avoid the `.` if there’s an alternative 
For example, Use `_[^_]+_` instead of `_.*_` to match `_texthere_` 
Use reasonable ranges (for example, `{1,10}` ) for repeating patterns instead of unbounded `*` and `+` matchers 
When possible, perform simple input validation such as maximum string length checks before using regular expressions

Description,Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)/Description,"A Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) is an attack in which an attacker is able coerce a application into making an outbound request to an unintended resource. This resource is usually internal. In GitLab, the connection most commonly uses HTTP, but an SSRF can be performed with any protocol, such as Redis or SSH.
With an SSRF attack, the UI may or may not show the response. The latter is called a Blind SSRF. While the impact is reduced, it can still be useful for attackers, especially for mapping internal network services as part of recon.",,
Impact,Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)/Impact,"The impact of an SSRF can vary, depending on what the application server can communicate with, how much the attacker can control of the payload, and if the response is returned back to the attacker. Examples of impact that have been reported to GitLab include:
Network mapping of internal services 
This can help an attacker gather information about internal services that could be used in further attacks. More details . 
Reading internal services, including cloud service metadata. 
The latter can be a serious problem, because an attacker can obtain keys that allow control of the victim’s cloud infrastructure. (This is also a good reason to give only necessary privileges to the token.). More details .

Mitigations,Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)/Mitigations,"In order to mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities, it is necessary to validate the destination of the outgoing request, especially if it includes user-supplied information.
The preferred SSRF mitigations within GitLab are:
Only connect to known, trusted domains/IP addresses. 
Use the Gitlab::HTTP library 
Implement feature-specific mitigations",,
GitLab HTTP Library,Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)/Mitigations/GitLab HTTP Library,"The Gitlab::HTTP wrapper library has grown to include mitigations for all of the GitLab-known SSRF vectors. It is also configured to respect the `Outboundrequests` options that allow instance administrators to block all internal connections, or limit the networks to which connections can be made. The `Gitlab::HTTP` wrapper library deletages the requests to the gitlab-http gem.
In some cases, it has been possible to configure `Gitlab::HTTP` as the HTTP connection library for 3rd-party gems. This is preferable over re-implementing the mitigations for a new feature.
More details",,
URL blocker & validation libraries,Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)/Mitigations/URL blocker & validation libraries,"Gitlab::HTTP_V2::UrlBlocker can be used to validate that a provided URL meets a set of constraints. Importantly, when `dns_rebind_protection` is `true` , the method returns a known-safe URI where the hostname has been replaced with an IP address. This prevents DNS rebinding attacks, because the DNS record has been resolved. However, if we ignore this returned value, we will not be protected against DNS rebinding.
This is the case with validators such as the `AddressableUrlValidator` (called with `validates:url,addressable_url:{opts}` or `public_url:{opts}` ). Validation errors are only raised when validations are called, for example when a record is created or saved. If we ignore the value returned by the validation when persisting the record, we need to recheck its validity before using it. For more information, see Time of check to time of use bugs .",,
Feature-specific mitigations,Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)/Mitigations/Feature-specific mitigations,"There are many tricks to bypass common SSRF validations. If feature-specific mitigations are necessary, they should be reviewed by the AppSec team, or a developer who has worked on SSRF mitigations previously.
For situations in which you can’t use an allowlist or GitLab:HTTP, you must implement mitigations directly in the feature. It’s best to validate the destination IP addresses themselves, not just domain names, as the attacker can control DNS. Below is a list of mitigations that you should implement.
Block connections to all localhost addresses 
`127.0.0.1/8` (IPv4 - note the subnet mask) 
`::1` (IPv6) 
Block connections to networks with private addressing (RFC 1918) 
`10.0.0.0/8` 
`172.16.0.0/12` 
`192.168.0.0/24` 
Block connections to link-local addresses (RFC 3927) 
`169.254.0.0/16` 
In particular, for GCP: `metadata.google.internal` -> `169.254.169.254` 
For HTTP connections: Disable redirects or validate the redirect destination 
To mitigate DNS rebinding attacks, validate and use the first IP address received.
See url_blocker_spec.rb for examples of SSRF payloads. For more information about the DNS-rebinding class of bugs, see Time of check to time of use bugs .
Don’t rely on methods like `.start_with?` when validating a URL, or make assumptions about which part of a string maps to which part of a URL. Use the `URI` class to parse the string, and validate each component (scheme, host, port, path, and so on). Attackers can create valid URLs which look safe, but lead to malicious locations.","user_supplied_url = ""https://my-safe-site.com@my-evil-site.com"" # Content before an @ in a URL is usually for basic authentication
user_supplied_url.start_with?(""https://my-safe-site.com"")       # Don't trust with start_with? for URLs!
=> true
URI.parse(user_supplied_url).host
=> ""my-evil-site.com""

Description,XSS guidelines/Description,"Cross site scripting (XSS) is an issue where malicious JavaScript code gets injected into a trusted web application and executed in a client’s browser. The input is intended to be data, but instead gets treated as code by the browser.
XSS issues are commonly classified in three categories, by their delivery method:
Persistent XSS 
Reflected XSS 
DOM XSS",,
Impact,XSS guidelines/Impact,"The injected client-side code is executed on the victim’s browser in the context of their current session. This means the attacker could perform any same action the victim would typically be able to do through a browser. The attacker would also have the ability to:
log victim keystrokes 
launch a network scan from the victim’s browser 
potentially 
obtain the victim’s session tokens 
perform actions that lead to data loss/theft or account takeover
Much of the impact is contingent upon the function of the application and the capabilities of the victim’s session. For further impact possibilities, check out the beef project .
For a demonstration of the impact on GitLab with a realistic attack scenario, see this video on the GitLab Unfiltered channel (internal, it requires being logged in with the GitLab Unfiltered account).",,

Based on the expectations you defined above : 
Validate the 
input size limits . 
Validate the input using an 
allowlist approach to only allow characters through which you are expecting to receive for the field. 
Input which fails validation should be rejected , and not sanitized. 
When adding redirects or links to a user-controlled URL, ensure that the scheme is HTTP or HTTPS. Allowing other schemes like `javascript://` can lead to XSS and other security issues.
Note that denylists should be avoided, as it is near impossible to block all variations of XSS .",,
Output encoding,XSS guidelines/Mitigation/Input validation/Output encoding,"Once you’ve determined when and where the user submitted data will be output, it’s important to encode it based on the appropriate context. For example:
Content placed inside HTML elements need to be HTML entity encoded . 
Content placed into a JSON response needs to be JSON encoded . 
Content placed inside 
HTML URL GET parameters need to be URL-encoded 
Additional contexts may require context-specific encoding .",,
XSS mitigation and prevention in Rails,XSS guidelines/Mitigation/Input validation/Additional information/XSS mitigation and prevention in Rails,"By default, Rails automatically escapes strings when they are inserted into HTML templates. Avoid the methods used to keep Rails from escaping strings, especially those related to user-controlled values.

In case you want to sanitize user-controlled values against XSS vulnerabilities, you can use ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper . Calling `link_to` and `redirect_to` with user-controlled parameters can also lead to cross-site scripting.
Do also sanitize and validate URL schemes.

Description,Path Traversal guidelines/Description,"Path Traversal vulnerabilities grant attackers access to arbitrary directories and files on the server that is executing an application. This data can include data, code or credentials.
Traversal can occur when a path includes directories. A typical malicious example includes one or more `../` , which tells the file system to look in the parent directory. Supplying many of them in a path, for example `../../../../../../../etc/passwd` , usually resolves to `/etc/passwd` . If the file system is instructed to look back to the root directory and can’t go back any further, then extra `../` are ignored. The file system then looks from the root, resulting in `/etc/passwd` - a file you definitely do not want exposed to a malicious attacker!",,

Time of check to time of use bugs,Time of check to time of use bugs,"Time of check to time of use, or TOCTOU, is a class of error which occur when the state of something changes unexpectedly partway during a process. More specifically, it’s when the property you checked and validated has changed when you finally get around to using that property.
These types of bugs are often seen in environments which allow multi-threading and concurrency, like filesystems and distributed web applications; these are a type of race condition. TOCTOU also occurs when state is checked and stored, then after a period of time that state is relied on without re-checking its accuracy and/or validity.",,
Examples,Time of check to time of use bugs/Examples,"Example 1: you have a model which accepts a URL as input. When the model is created you verify that the URL host resolves to a public IP address, to prevent attackers making internal network calls. But DNS records can change ( DNS rebinding ]). An attacker updates the DNS record to `127.0.0.1` , and when your code resolves those URL host it results in sending a potentially malicious request to a server on the internal network. The property was valid at the “time of check”, but invalid and malicious at “time of use”.
GitLab-specific example can be found in this issue where, although `Gitlab::HTTP_V2::UrlBlocker.validate!` was called, the returned value was not used. This made it vulnerable to TOCTOU bug and SSRF protection bypass through DNS rebinding . The fix was to use the validated IP address .
Example 2: you have a feature which schedules jobs. When the user schedules the job, they have permission to do so. But imagine if, between the time they schedule the job and the time it is run, their permissions are restricted. Unless you re-check permissions at time of use, you could inadvertently allow unauthorized activity.
Example 3: you need to fetch a remote file, and perform a `HEAD` request to get and validate the content length and content type. When you subsequently make a `GET` request, though, the file delivered is a different size or different file type. (This is stretching the definition of TOCTOU, but things have changed between time of check and time of use).
Example 4: you allow users to upvote a comment if they haven’t already. The server is multi-threaded, and you aren’t using transactions or an applicable database index. By repeatedly selecting upvote in quick succession a malicious user is able to add multiple upvotes: the requests arrive at the same time, the checks run in parallel and confirm that no upvote exists yet, and so each upvote is written to the database.
Here’s some pseudocode showing an example of a potential TOCTOU bug:","def upvote(comment, user)
  # The time between calling .exists? and .create can lead to TOCTOU,
  # particularly if .create is a slow method, or runs in a background job
  if Upvote.exists?(comment: comment, user: user)

Tokens (PAT, runner authentication tokens, JWT token, CSRF tokens, project access tokens, etc). 
Session cookies. 
Any other piece of information that can be used for authentication or authorization purposes.
This sensitive data must be handled carefully to avoid leaks which could lead to unauthorized access. If you have questions or need help with any of the following guidance, talk to the GitLab AppSec team on Slack ( `#sec-appsec` ).",,
At rest,Handling credentials/At rest,"Credentials must be encrypted while at rest (database or file) with `attr_encrypted` . See issue #26243 before using `attr_encrypted` . 
Store the encryption keys separately from the encrypted credentials with proper access control. For instance, store the keys in a vault, KMS, or file. Here is an example use of `attr_encrypted` for encryption with keys stored in separate access controlled file. 
When the intention is to only compare secrets, store only the salted hash of the secret instead of the encrypted value. 
Salted hashes should be used to store any sensitive value where the plaintext value itself does not need to be retrieved. 
Never commit credentials to repositories. 
The Gitleaks Git hook is recommended for preventing credentials from being committed. 
Never log credentials under any circumstance. Issue #353857 is an example of credential leaks through log file. 
When credentials are required in a CI/CD job, use masked variables to help prevent accidental exposure in the job logs. Be aware that when debug logging is enabled, all masked CI/CD variables are visible in job logs. Also consider using protected variables when possible so that sensitive CI/CD variables are only available to pipelines running on protected branches or protected tags. 
Proper scanners must be enabled depending on what data those credentials are protecting. See the Application Security Inventory Policy and our Data Classification Standards . 
To store and/or share credentials between teams, refer to 1Password for Teams and follow the 1Password Guidelines . 
If you need to share a secret with a team member, use 1Password. Do not share a secret over email, Slack, or other service on the Internet.",,

What should be captured in the logs,Logging/What should be captured in the logs,"The application logs must record attributes of the event, which helps auditors identify the time/date, IP, user ID, and event details. 
To avoid resource depletion, make sure the proper level for logging is used (for example, `information` , `error` , or `fatal` ).",,
What should not be captured in the logs,Logging/What should not be captured in the logs,"Personal data, except for integer-based identifiers and UUIDs, or IP address, which can be logged when necessary. 
Credentials like access tokens or passwords. If credentials must be captured for debugging purposes, log the internal ID of the credential (if available) instead. Never log credentials under any circumstances. 
When debug logging is enabled, all masked CI/CD variables are visible in job logs. Consider using protected variables when possible so that sensitive CI/CD variables are only available to pipelines running on protected branches or protected tags. 
Any data supplied by the user without proper validation. 
Any information that might be considered sensitive (for example, credentials, passwords, tokens, keys, or secrets). Here is an example of sensitive information being leaked through logs.",,
Protecting log files,Logging/Protecting log files,"Access to the log files should be restricted so that only the intended party can modify the logs. 
External user input should not be directly captured in the logs without any validation. This could lead to unintended modification of logs through log injection attacks. 
An audit trail for log edits must be available. 
To avoid data loss, logs must be saved on different storage.",,
URL Spoofing,URL Spoofing,"We want to protect our users from bad actors who might try to use GitLab features to redirect other users to malicious sites.
Many features in GitLab allow users to post links to external websites. It is important that the destination of any user-specified link is made very clear to the user.",,
external_redirect_path,URL Spoofing/external_redirect_path,"When presenting links provided by users, if the actual URL is hidden, use the `external_redirect_path` helper method to redirect the user to a warning page first. For example:","# Bad :(
# This URL comes from User-Land and may not be safe...
# We need the user to *see* where they are going.
link_to foo_social_url(@user), title: ""Foo Social"" do
  sprite_icon('question-o')

# Good :)
# The external_redirect ""leaving GitLab"" page will show the URL to the user
