Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
2.3.2 Special escape sequences
For any character that has a special escape sequence ( `\b` , `\t` , `\n` , `\f` , `\r` , `\"` , `\'` and `\\` ), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. `\012` ) or Unicode (e.g. `\u000a` ) escape.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
AvoidEscapedUnicodeCharacters
[Description]
Restricts using

Unicode escapes (such as \u221e).
It is possible to allow using escapes for

non-printable, control characters.
Also, this check can be configured to allow using escapes
if trail comment is present. By the option it is possible to
allow using escapes if literal contains only them.
[Rule]
FileTabCharacter
[Description]
Checks that there are no tab characters ('\t') in the source code.


Rationale:



Developers should not need to configure the tab width of their
text editors in order to be able to read source code.


From the Apache jakarta coding standards: In a distributed
development environment, when the commit messages get sent
to a mailing list, they are almost impossible to read if you
use tabs.
[Rule]
AvoidInlineConditionals
[Description]
Detects inline conditionals. Here is one example of an inline conditional:



String a = getParameter("a");
String b = (a==null || a.length()<1) ? null : a.substring(1);


Rationale: Some developers find inline conditionals hard to read, so
their employer's coding standards forbid them.
[Rule]
GenericWhitespace
[Description]
Checks that the whitespace around the Generic tokens (angle brackets)
"<" and ">" are correct to the typical convention.
The convention is not configurable.


Left angle bracket ("<"):


should be preceded with whitespace only in generic methods definitions.
should not be preceded with whitespace when it is preceded method name
or constructor.
should not be preceded with whitespace when following type name.
should not be followed with whitespace in all cases.


Right angle bracket (">"):


should not be preceded with whitespace in all cases.
should be followed with whitespace in almost all cases, except diamond operators
and when preceding a method name, constructor, or record header.
[Rule]
IllegalIdentifierName
[Description]
Checks identifiers with a pattern for a set of illegal names, such as those
that are restricted or contextual keywords. Examples include "yield", "record",
"_", and "var". Please read more at

Java Language Specification
to get to know more about restricted keywords. Since this check uses a
pattern to specify valid identifiers, users can also prohibit the usage
of certain symbols, such as "$", or any non-ascii character.
[Rule]
StringLiteralEquality
[Description]
Checks that string literals are not used with == or
!=.
Since == will compare the object references,
not the actual value of the strings,
String.equals() should be used.
More information can be found

in this article.


Rationale: Novice Java programmers often use code like:



if (x == "something")

when they mean


if ("something".equals(x))
[Rule]
TrailingComment
[Description]
The check to ensure that lines with code do not end with comment.
For the case of // comments that means that the only thing
that should precede it is whitespace. It doesn't check comments if
they do not end a line; for example, it accepts the following:
Thread.sleep( 10 /*some comment here*/ ); Format
property is intended to deal with the } // while example.


Rationale: Steve McConnell in Code Complete suggests that
endline comments are a bad practice. An end line comment would be
one that is on the same line as actual code. For example:



a = b + c;      // Some insightful comment
d = e / f;        // Another comment for this line


Quoting Code Complete for the justification:


"The comments have to be aligned so that they do not
interfere with the visual structure of the code. If you don't align
them neatly, they'll make your listing look like it's been through a
washing machine."

"Endline comments tend to be hard to format...It takes
time to align them. Such time is not spent learning more about the
code; it's dedicated solely to the tedious task of pressing the
spacebar or tab key."

"Endline comments are also hard to maintain. If the code
on any line containing an endline comment grows, it bumps the
comment farther out, and all the other endline comments will have to
bumped out to match. Styles that are hard to maintain aren't
maintained...."

"Endline comments also tend to be cryptic. The right side
of the line doesn't offer much room and the desire to keep the
comment on one line means the comment must be short. Work then goes
into making the line as short as possible instead of as clear as
possible. The comment usually ends up as cryptic as
possible...."

"A systemic problem with endline comments is that it's
hard to write a meaningful comment for one line of code. Most
endline comments just repeat the line of code, which hurts more than
it helps."



McConnell's comments on being hard to maintain when the size of the line
changes are even more important in the age of automated
refactorings.
[Rule]
MagicNumber
[Description]
Checks that there are no

"magic numbers" where a magic
number is a numeric literal that is not defined as a constant.
By default, -1, 0, 1, and 2 are not considered to be magic numbers.


Constant definition is any variable/field that has 'final' modifier.
It is fine to have one constant defining multiple numeric literals within one expression:



static final int SECONDS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60;
static final double SPECIAL_RATIO = 4.0 / 3.0;
static final double SPECIAL_SUM = 1 + Math.E;
static final double SPECIAL_DIFFERENCE = 4 - Math.PI;
static final Border STANDARD_BORDER = BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(3, 3, 3, 3);
static final Integer ANSWER_TO_THE_ULTIMATE_QUESTION_OF_LIFE = new Integer(42);
[Rule]
HideUtilityClassConstructor
[Description]
Makes sure that utility classes (classes that contain only static
methods or fields in their API) do not have a public constructor.


Rationale: Instantiating utility classes does not make sense. Hence,
the constructors should either be private or (if you want to allow
subclassing) protected. A common mistake is forgetting to hide the
default constructor.


If you make the constructor protected you may want to consider the
following constructor implementation technique to disallow
instantiating subclasses:



public class StringUtils // not final to allow subclassing
{
protected StringUtils() {
// prevents calls from subclass
throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

public static int count(char c, String s) {
// ...
}
}
[Rule]
RightCurly
[Description]
Checks the placement of right curly braces ('}') for code blocks.
This check supports if-else, try-catch-finally blocks, switch statements, switch cases,
while-loops, for-loops, method definitions, class definitions, constructor definitions,
instance, static initialization blocks, annotation definitions and enum definitions.
For right curly brace of expression blocks of arrays, lambdas and class instances
please follow issue
#5945.
For right curly brace of enum constant please follow issue
#7519.

    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
