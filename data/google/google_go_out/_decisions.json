See more about so-called “utility packages” .\nWhen an imported package is renamed (e.g. `importfoopb\"path/to/foo_go_proto\"` ), the local name for the package must comply with the rules above, as the local name dictates how the symbols in the package are referenced in the file.

A variable created at file scope may require multiple words, whereas a variable scoped to a single inner block may be a single word or even just a character or two, to keep the code clear and avoid extraneous information.\nHere is a rough baseline. These numeric guidelines are not strict rules. Apply judgement based on context, clarity , and concision .\nA small scope is one in which one or two small operations are performed, say 1-7 lines. \nA medium scope is a few small or one large operation, say 8-15 lines. \nA large scope is one or a few large operations, say 15-25 lines. \nA very large scope is anything that spans more than a page (say, more than 25 lines).\nA name that might be perfectly clear (e.g., `c` for a counter) within a small scope could be insufficient in a larger scope and would require clarification to remind the reader of its purpose further along in the code. A scope in which there are many variables, or variables that represent similar values or concepts, may necessitate longer variable names than the scope suggests.\nThe specificity of the concept can also help to keep a variable’s name concise. For example, assuming there is only a single database in use, a short variable name like `db` that might normally be reserved for very small scopes may remain perfectly clear even if the scope is very large. In this case, a single word `database` is likely acceptable based on the size of the scope, but is not required as `db` is a very common shortening for the word with few alternate interpretations.\nThe name of a local variable should reflect what it contains and how it is being used in the current context, rather than where the value originated. For example, it is often the case that the best local variable name is not the same as the struct or protocol buffer field name.\nIn general:\nSingle-word names like `count` or `options` are a good starting point. \nAdditional words can be added to disambiguate similar names, for example `userCount` and `projectCount` . \nDo not simply drop letters to save typing. For example `Sandbox` is preferred over `Sbx` , particularly for exported names. \nOmit types and type-like words from most variable names. \nFor a number, `userCount` is a better name than `numUsers` or `usersInt` . \nFor a slice, `users` is a better name than `userSlice` . \nIt is acceptable to include a type-like qualifier if there are two versions of a value in scope, for example you might have an input stored in `ageString` and use `age` for the parsed value. \nOmit words that are clear from the surrounding context . For example, in the implementation of a `UserCount` method, a local variable called `userCount` is probably redundant; `count` , `users` , or even `c` are just as readable."

However, it quite deliberately considers values that have the same visual representation as equal.

It also serializes the entire value into a string before producing a diff, and as such is not a good choice for comparing large values. By default, it compares unexported fields, which makes it sensitive to changes in implementation details in your dependencies. For this reason, it is not appropriate to use `pretty` on protobuf messages.\nPrefer using `cmp` for new code, and it is worth considering updating older code to use `cmp` where and when it is practical to do so.\nOlder code may use the standard library `reflect.DeepEqual` function to compare complex structures. `reflect.DeepEqual` should not be used for checking equality, as it is sensitive to changes in unexported fields and other implementation details. Code that is using `reflect.DeepEqual` should be updated to one of the above libraries.\nNote: The `cmp` package is designed for testing, rather than production use. As such, it may panic when it suspects that a comparison is performed incorrectly to provide instruction to users on how to improve the test to be less brittle.
