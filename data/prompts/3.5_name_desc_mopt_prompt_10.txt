Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
3.3.4 No static import for classes
Static import is not used for static nested classes. They are imported with normal imports.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
AvoidStaticImport
[Description]
Checks that there are no static import statements.


Rationale: Importing static members can lead to naming
conflicts between class' members. It may lead to poor code
readability since it may no longer be clear what class a
member resides in (without looking at the import statement).
[Options]
excludes, Control whether to allow for certain classes via a star notation to be excluded such as java.lang.Math.* or specific static members to be excluded like java.lang.System.out for a variable or java.lang.Math.random for a method. See notes section for details.
[Rule]
RedundantImport
[Description]
Checks for redundant import statements. An import statement is
considered redundant if:



It is a duplicate of another import. This is, when a class is
imported more than once.


The class non-statically imported is from the java.lang
package, e.g. importing java.lang.String.


The class non-statically imported is from the same package as the current package.
[Options]
[Rule]
AvoidStarImport
[Description]
Checks that there are no import statements that use the * notation.


Rationale: Importing all classes from a package or static
members from a class leads to tight coupling between packages
or classes and might lead to problems when a new version of a
library introduces name clashes.
[Options]
allowClassImports, Control whether to allow starred class imports like import java.util.*;.
allowStaticMemberImports, Control whether to allow starred static member imports like import static org.junit.Assert.*;.
excludes, Specify packages where starred class imports are allowed and classes where starred static member imports are allowed.
[Rule]
ImportOrder
[Description]
Checks the ordering/grouping of imports. Features are:

groups type/static imports: ensures that groups of imports come in a
specific order (e.g., java. comes first, javax. comes second,
then everything else)
adds a separation between type import groups : ensures that a blank
line sit between each group
type/static import groups aren't separated internally: ensures that
each group aren't separated internally by blank line or comment
sorts type/static imports inside each group: ensures that imports
within each group are in lexicographic order

sorts according to case: ensures that the comparison
between imports is case-sensitive, in
ASCII sort order


arrange static imports: ensures the relative order between
type imports and static imports (see
ImportOrderOption)
[Options]
caseSensitive, Control whether string comparison should be case-sensitive or not. Case-sensitive sorting is in ASCII sort order. It affects both type imports and static imports.
groups, Specify list of type import groups. Every group identified either by a common prefix string, or by a regular expression enclosed in forward slashes (e.g. /regexp/). All type imports, which does not match any group, falls into an additional group, located at the end. Thus, the empty list of type groups (the default value) means one group for all type imports.
option, Specify policy on the relative order between type imports and static imports.
ordered, Control whether type imports within each group should be sorted. It doesn't affect sorting for static imports.
separated, Control whether type import groups should be separated by, at least, one blank line or comment and aren't separated internally. It doesn't affect separations for static imports.
separatedStaticGroups, Control whether static import groups should be separated by, at least, one blank line or comment and aren't separated internally. This property has effect only when the property option is set to top or bottom and when property staticGroups is enabled.
sortStaticImportsAlphabetically, Control whether static imports located at top or bottom are sorted within the group.
staticGroups, Specify list of static import groups. Every group identified either by a common prefix string, or by a regular expression enclosed in forward slashes (e.g. /regexp/). All static imports, which does not match any group, fall into an additional group, located at the end. Thus, the empty list of static groups (the default value) means one group for all static imports. This property has effect only when the property option is set to top or bottom.
useContainerOrderingForStatic, Control whether to use container ordering (Eclipse IDE term) for static imports or not.
[Rule]
ClassMemberImpliedModifier
[Description]
Checks for implicit modifiers on nested types in classes and records.


This check is effectively the opposite of
RedundantModifier.
It checks the modifiers on nested types in classes and records, ensuring that certain
modifiers are explicitly specified even though they are actually redundant.


Nested enums, interfaces, and records within a class are always static and as
such the compiler does not require the static modifier. This check provides
the ability to enforce that the static modifier is explicitly coded and not
implicitly added by the compiler.



public final class Person {
enum Age {  // violation
CHILD, ADULT
}
}


Rationale for this check:
Nested enums, interfaces, and records are treated differently from nested classes as they
are only allowed to be static. Developers should not need to remember this
rule, and this check provides the means to enforce that the modifier is coded explicitly.
[Options]
violateImpliedStaticOnNestedEnum, Control whether to enforce that static is explicitly coded on nested enums in classes and records.
violateImpliedStaticOnNestedInterface, Control whether to enforce that static is explicitly coded on nested interfaces in classes and records.
violateImpliedStaticOnNestedRecord, Control whether to enforce that static is explicitly coded on nested records in classes and records.
[Rule]
UnusedImports
[Description]
Checks for unused import statements. An
import statement is considered unused if:



It is not referenced in the file. The algorithm does not support
wild-card imports like import
java.io.*;. Most IDE's provide very sophisticated checks
for imports that handle wild-card imports.


The class imported is from the java.lang
package. For example importing java.lang.String.


The class imported is from the same package.


A static method is imported when used as method reference. In that case,
only the type needs to be imported and that's enough to resolve the method.


Optionally: it is referenced in Javadoc comments. This check
is on by default, but it is considered bad practice to introduce
a compile-time dependency for documentation purposes only.
As an example, the import java.util.List would be
considered referenced with the Javadoc comment
{@link List}. The alternative to avoid introducing a
compile-time dependency would be to write the Javadoc comment as
{@link java.util.List}.



The main limitation of this check is handling the cases where:



An imported type has the same name as a declaration, such as a member variable.


There are two or more static imports with the same method name
(javac can distinguish imports with same name but different parameters, but checkstyle
can not due to
limitation.)
[Options]
processJavadoc, Control whether to process Javadoc comments.
[Rule]
PackageDeclaration
[Description]
Ensures that a class has a package declaration, and (optionally) whether
the package name matches the directory name for the source file.


Rationale: Classes that live in the null package cannot be
imported. Many novice developers are not aware of this.


Packages provide logical namespace to classes and should be stored in
the form of directory levels to provide physical grouping to your classes.
These directories are added to the classpath so that your classes
are visible to JVM when it runs the code.
[Options]
matchDirectoryStructure, Control whether to check for directory and package name match.
[Rule]
HideUtilityClassConstructor
[Description]
Makes sure that utility classes (classes that contain only static
methods or fields in their API) do not have a public constructor.


Rationale: Instantiating utility classes does not make sense. Hence,
the constructors should either be private or (if you want to allow
subclassing) protected. A common mistake is forgetting to hide the
default constructor.


If you make the constructor protected you may want to consider the
following constructor implementation technique to disallow
instantiating subclasses:



public class StringUtils // not final to allow subclassing
{
protected StringUtils() {
// prevents calls from subclass
throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

public static int count(char c, String s) {
// ...
}
}
[Options]
[Rule]
InnerTypeLast
[Description]
Checks nested (internal) classes/interfaces are declared at the bottom of the
primary (top-level) class after all init and static init blocks,
method, constructor and field declarations.
[Options]
[Rule]
FinalClass
[Description]
Ensures that identifies classes that can be effectively declared as final are explicitly
marked as final. The following are different types of classes that can be identified:



Private classes with no declared constructors.


Classes with any modifier, and contains only private constructors.



Classes are skipped if:



Class is Super class of some Anonymous inner class.


Class is extended by another class in the same file.
[Options]
