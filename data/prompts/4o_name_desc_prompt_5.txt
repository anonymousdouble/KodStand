Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
3.1 License or copyright information, if present
If license or copyright information belongs in a file, it belongs here.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
OneTopLevelClass
[Description]
Checks that each top-level class, interface, enum
or annotation resides in a source file of its own.
Official description of a 'top-level' term:
7.6. Top Level Type Declarations.
If file doesn't contain public class, interface, enum or annotation,
top-level type is the first type in file.
[Rule]
NoCodeInFile
[Description]
Checks whether file contains code.
Java compiler is not raising errors on files with no code or all commented out.
Files which are considered to have no code:



File with no text


File with single-line comment(s)


File with a multi line comment(s).
[Rule]
PackageAnnotation
[Description]
Checks that all package annotations are in the package-info.java file.


For Java SE8 and above, placement of package annotations in the package-info.java
file is enforced by the compiler and this check is not necessary.


For Java SE7 and below, the Java Language Specification highly recommends
but doesn't require that annotations are placed in the package-info.java file,
and this check can help to enforce that placement.


See
Java Language Specification, ¡ì7.4.1 for more info.
[Rule]
FileLength
[Description]
Checks for long source files.


Rationale: If a source file becomes very long it is hard to
understand. Therefore, long classes should usually be refactored
into several individual classes that focus on a specific task.
[Rule]
PackageDeclaration
[Description]
Ensures that a class has a package declaration, and (optionally) whether
the package name matches the directory name for the source file.


Rationale: Classes that live in the null package cannot be
imported. Many novice developers are not aware of this.


Packages provide logical namespace to classes and should be stored in
the form of directory levels to provide physical grouping to your classes.
These directories are added to the classpath so that your classes
are visible to JVM when it runs the code.
[Rule]
JavadocPackage
[Description]
Checks that each Java package has a Javadoc file used for
commenting. By default, it only allows a package-info.java file, but can be
configured to allow a package.html
file.


A violation will be reported if both files exist as this is not
allowed by the Javadoc tool.
[Rule]
OuterTypeFilename
[Description]
Checks that the outer type name and the file name match. For example,
the class Foo must be in a file named
Foo.java.
[Rule]
CommentsIndentation
[Description]
Controls the indentation between comments and surrounding code.
Comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code.
Detailed info about such convention can be found

here
[Rule]
HideUtilityClassConstructor
[Description]
Makes sure that utility classes (classes that contain only static
methods or fields in their API) do not have a public constructor.


Rationale: Instantiating utility classes does not make sense. Hence,
the constructors should either be private or (if you want to allow
subclassing) protected. A common mistake is forgetting to hide the
default constructor.


If you make the constructor protected you may want to consider the
following constructor implementation technique to disallow
instantiating subclasses:



public class StringUtils // not final to allow subclassing
{
protected StringUtils() {
// prevents calls from subclass
throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

public static int count(char c, String s) {
// ...
}
}
[Rule]
LineLength
[Description]
Checks for long lines.


Rationale: Long lines are hard to read in printouts or if developers
have limited screen space for the source code, e.g. if the IDE
displays additional information like project tree, class hierarchy,
etc.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
