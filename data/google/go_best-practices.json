                "description": "If you’re asking yourself how big your Go packages should be and whether to place related types in the same package or split them into different ones, a good place to start is the Go blog post about package names . Despite the post title, it’s not solely about naming. It contains some helpful hints and cites several useful articles and talks.\nHere are some other considerations and notes.\nUsers see godoc for the package in one page, and any methods exported by types supplied by the package are grouped by their type. Godoc also group constructors along with the types they return. If client code is likely to need two values of different type to interact with each other, it may be convenient for the user to have them in the same package.\nCode within a package can access unexported identifiers in the package. If you have a few related types whose implementation is tightly coupled, placing them in the same package lets you achieve this coupling without polluting the public API with these details. A good test for this coupling is to imagine a hypothetical user of two packages, where the packages cover closely related topics: if the user must import both packages in order to use either in any meaningful way, combining them together is usually the right thing to do. The standard library generally demonstrates this kind of scoping and layering well.\nAll of that being said, putting your entire project in a single package would likely make that package too large. When something is conceptually distinct, giving it its own small package can make it easier to use. The short name of the package as known to clients together with the exported type name work together to make a meaningful identifier: e.g. `bytes.Buffer` , `ring.New` . The blog post has more examples.\nGo style is flexible about file size, because maintainers can move code within a package from one file to another without affecting callers. But as a general guideline: it is usually not a good idea to have a single file with many thousands of lines in it, or having many tiny files. There is no “one type, one file” convention as in some other languages. As a rule of thumb, files should be focused enough that a maintainer can tell which file contains something, and the files should be small enough that it will be easy to find once there. The standard library often splits large packages to several source files, grouping related code by file. The source for package\n \n bytes is a good example. Packages with long package documentation may choose to dedicate one file called `doc.go` that has the package documentation , a package declaration, and nothing else, but this is not required.\nWithin the Google codebase and in projects using Bazel, directory layout for Go code is different than it is in open source Go projects: you can have multiple `go_library` targets in a single directory. A good reason to give each package its own directory is if you expect to open source your project in the future.\nSee also:\nTest double packages"

In general, this is only done when a failure of the invariant check means that the internal state has become unrecoverable. The most reliable way to do this in the Google codebase is to call `log.Fatal` . Using `panic` in these cases is not reliable, because it is possible for deferred functions to deadlock or further corrupt internal or external state.\nSimilarly, resist the temptation to recover panics to avoid crashes, as doing so can result in propagating a corrupted state. The further you are from the panic, the less you know about the state of the program, which could be holding locks or other resources. The program can then develop other unexpected failure modes that can make the problem even more difficult to diagnose. Instead of trying to handle unexpected panics in code, use monitoring tools to surface unexpected failures and fix related bugs with a high priority.\nNote: The standard net/http\n \n server violates this advice and recovers panics from request handlers.

For example, binary settings should accept a boolean (e.g. `rpc.FailFast(enablebool)` is preferable to `rpc.EnableFailFast()` ). An enumerated option should accept an enumerated constant (e.g. `log.Format(log.Capacitor)` is preferable to `log.CapacitorFormat()` ). The alternative makes it much more difficult for users who must programmatically choose which options to pass; such users are forced to change the actual composition of the parameters rather than simply changing the arguments to the options. Don’t assume that all users will know the full set of options statically.\nIn general, options should be processed in order. If there is a conflict or if a non-cumulative option is passed multiple times, the last argument should win.\nThe parameter to the option function is generally unexported in this pattern, to restrict the options to being defined only within the package itself. This is a good default, though there may be times when it is appropriate to allow other packages to define options.\nSee Rob Pike’s original blog post and Dave Cheney’s talk for a more in-depth look at how these options can be used."

                "description": "Go distinguishes between “test helpers” and “assertion helpers”:\nTest helpers are functions that do setup or cleanup tasks. All failures that occur in test helpers are expected to be failures of the environment (not from the code under test) — for example when a test database cannot be started because there are no more free ports on this machine. For functions like these, calling `t.Helper` is often appropriate to mark them as a test helper . See error handling in test helpers for more details. \nAssertion helpers are functions that check the correctness of a system and fail the test if an expectation is not met. Assertion helpers are not considered idiomatic in Go.\nThe purpose of a test is to report pass/fail conditions of the code under test. The ideal place to fail a test is within the `Test` function itself, as that ensures that failure messages and the test logic are clear.\nAs your testing code grows, it may become necessary to factor out some functionality to separate functions. Standard software engineering considerations still apply, as test code is still code . If the functionality does not interact with the testing framework, then all of the usual rules apply. When the common code interacts with the framework, however, some care must be taken to avoid common pitfalls that can lead to uninformative failure messages and unmaintainable tests.\nIf many separate test cases require the same validation logic, arrange the test in one of the following ways instead of using assertion helpers or complex validation functions:\nInline the logic (both the validation and the failure) in the `Test` function, even if it is repetitive. This works best in simple cases. \nIf inputs are similar, consider unifying them into a table-driven test while keeping the logic inlined in the loop. This helps to avoid repetition while keeping the validation and failure in the `Test` . \nIf there are multiple callers who need the same validation function but table tests are not suitable (typically because the inputs are not simple enough or the validation is required as part of a sequence of operations), arrange the validation function so that it returns a value (typically an `error` ) rather than taking a `testing.T` parameter and using it to fail the test. Use logic within the `Test` to decide whether to fail, and to provide useful test failures . You can also create test helpers to factor out common boilerplate setup code.\nThe design outlined in the last point maintains orthogonality. For example, package\n \n cmp is not designed to fail tests, but rather to compare (and to diff) values. It therefore does not need to know about the context in which the comparison was made, since the caller can supply that. If your common testing code provides a `cmp.Transformer` for your data type, that can often be the simplest design. For other validations, consider returning an `error` value.",

Moreover, these sidecars often interact with external distributed systems. \nFurther, the same stateless, idempotent, and local rules in addition to the base considerations above would apply to the code of the sidecar process itself!\nAn example of one of these safe situations is package image with its image.RegisterFormat function. Consider the litmus tests from above applied to a typical decoder, like the one for handling the PNG format:\nMultiple calls to `packageimage` ’s APIs that use the registered decoders (for example, `image.Decode` ) cannot interfere with one another, similarly for tests. The only exception is `image.RegisterFormat` , but that is mitigated by the points below. \nIt is extremely unlikely that a user would want to replace a decoder with a test double , as the PNG decoder exemplifies a case in which our codebase’s preference for real objects applies. However, a user would be more likely to replace a decoder with a test double if the decoder statefully interacted with operating system resources (for example, the network). \nCollisions in registration are conceivable, though they are probably rare in practice. \nThe decoders are stateless, idempotent, and pure."

A good example of this is http.Handle internally calling (*http.ServeMux).Handle on the package variable http.DefaultServeMux . \nThis package-level API must only be used by binary build targets , not libraries , unless the libraries are undertaking a refactoring to support dependency passing. Infrastructure libraries that can be imported by other packages must not rely on package-level state of the packages they import. \nFor example, an infrastructure provider implementing a sidecar that is to be shared with other teams using the API from the top should offer an API to accommodate this:",
