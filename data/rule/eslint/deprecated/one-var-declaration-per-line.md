# one-var-declaration-per-line
## Overview

Require or disallow newlines around variable declarations

This rule was deprecated in ESLint v8.53.0. Please use the corresponding rule  in @stylistic/eslint-plugin-js .

Some developers declare multiple var statements on the same line:


```json
var foo, bar, baz;
```

Others prefer to declare one var per line.


```json
var foo,
    bar,
    baz;
```

Keeping to one of these styles across a projectâ€™s codebase can help with maintaining code consistency.
