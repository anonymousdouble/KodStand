Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.8.4.1 Indentation
As with any other block, the contents of a switch block are indented +2.
 After a switch label, there is a line break, and the indentation level is increased +2, exactly as if a block were being opened. The following switch label returns to the previous indentation level, as if a block had been closed.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
AvoidNestedBlocks
[Description]
Finds nested blocks (blocks that are used freely in the code).


Rationale: Nested blocks are often leftovers from the
debugging process, they confuse the reader.


For example, this check finds the obsolete braces in



public void guessTheOutput()
{
int whichIsWhich = 0;
{
whichIsWhich = 2;
}
System.out.println("value = " + whichIsWhich);
}

and debugging / refactoring leftovers such as


// if (conditionThatIsNotUsedAnyLonger)
{
System.out.println("unconditional");
}


A case in a switch statement does not implicitly form a block.
Thus, to be able to introduce local variables that have case
scope it is necessary to open a nested block. This is
supported, set the allowInSwitchCase property to true and
include all statements of the case in the block.
[Options]
allowInSwitchCase, Allow nested blocks if they are the only child of a switch case.
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Options]
arrayInitIndent, Specify how far an array initialization should be indented when on next line.
basicOffset, Specify how far new indentation level should be indented when on the next line.
braceAdjustment, Specify how far a braces should be indented when on the next line.
caseIndent, Specify how far a case label should be indented when on next line.
forceStrictCondition, Force strict indent level in line wrapping case. If value is true, line wrap indent have to be same as lineWrappingIndentation parameter. If value is false, line wrap indent could be bigger on any value user would like.
lineWrappingIndentation, Specify how far continuation line should be indented when line-wrapping is present.
throwsIndent, Specify how far a throws clause should be indented when on next line.
[Rule]
NoWhitespaceBeforeCaseDefaultColon
[Description]
Checks that there is no whitespace before the colon in a switch block.
[Options]
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Options]
offset, Specify how many spaces to use for new indentation level.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
CommentsIndentation
[Description]
Controls the indentation between comments and surrounding code.
Comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code.

[Rule]
EmptyBlock
[Description]
Checks for empty blocks. This check does not validate sequential blocks.
Sequential blocks won't be checked. Also, no violations for fallthrough:


switch (a) {
case 1:                          // no violation
case 2:                          // no violation
case 3: someMethod(); { }        // no violation
default: break;
}


NOTE: This check processes LITERAL_CASE and LITERAL_DEFAULT separately.
Verification empty block is done for single nearest {@code case} or {@code default}.
[Options]
option, Specify the policy on block contents.

[Rule]
MissingSwitchDefault
[Description]
Checks that switch statement has a default clause.


Rationale: It's usually a good idea to introduce a default case in
every switch statement. Even if the developer is sure that all
currently possible cases are covered, this should be expressed in
the default branch, e.g. by using an assertion. This way the code is
protected against later changes, e.g. introduction of new types in an
enumeration type.


This check does not validate any switch expressions. Rationale:
The compiler requires switch expressions to be exhaustive. This means
that all possible inputs must be covered.


This check does not validate switch statements that use pattern or null
labels. Rationale: Switch statements that use pattern or null labels are
checked by the compiler for exhaustiveness. This means that all possible
inputs must be covered.


See the

Java Language Specification for more information about switch statements
and expressions.
[Options]
[Rule]
InnerAssignment
[Description]
Checks for assignments in subexpressions, such as in
String s = Integer.toString(i = 2);.


Rationale: Except for the loop idioms,
all assignments should occur in their own top-level statement
to increase readability. With inner assignments like the one given above, it is difficult
to see all places where a variable is set.


Note: Check allows usage of the popular assignments in loops:



String line;
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { // OK
// process the line
}

for (;(line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null;) { // OK
// process the line
}

do {
// process the line
}
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null); // OK


Assignment inside a condition is not a problem here, as the assignment is surrounded by
an extra pair of parentheses. The comparison is != null and there is no
chance that intention was to write line == reader.readLine().
[Options]
[Rule]
RightCurly
[Description]
Checks the placement of right curly braces ('}') for code blocks.
This check supports if-else, try-catch-finally blocks, switch statements, switch cases,
while-loops, for-loops, method definitions, class definitions, constructor definitions,
instance, static initialization blocks, annotation definitions and enum definitions.
For right curly brace of expression blocks of arrays, lambdas and class instances
please follow issue
#5945.
For right curly brace of enum constant please follow issue
#7519.
[Options]
option, Specify the policy on placement of a right curly brace ('}').

[Rule]
SingleLineJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that a Javadoc block can fit in a single-line and doesn't
contain block tags. Javadoc comment that contains at least one block tag
should be formatted in a few lines.
[Options]
ignoreInlineTags, Control whether
inline tags must be ignored.
ignoredTags, Specify
block tags which are ignored by the check.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
