Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
7.1.2 Paragraphs
One blank line¡ªthat is, a line containing only the aligned leading asterisk ( `*` )¡ªappears between paragraphs, and before the group of block tags if present. Each paragraph except the first has `<p>` immediately before the first word, with no space after it. HTML tags for other block-level elements, such as `<ul>` or `<table>` , are not preceded with `<p>` .

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
JavadocParagraph
[Description]
Checks the Javadoc paragraph.


Checks that:



There is one blank line between each of two paragraphs.


Each paragraph but the first has <p> immediately before the first word, with
no space after.
[Options]
allowNewlineParagraph, Control whether the <p> tag should be placed immediately before the first word.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
RequireEmptyLineBeforeBlockTagGroup
[Description]
Checks that one blank line before the block tag if it is present in Javadoc.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocBlockTagLocation
[Description]
Checks that a

javadoc block tag appears only at the beginning of a line, ignoring
leading asterisks and white space. A block tag is a token that starts
with @ symbol and is preceded by a whitespace. This check
ignores block tags in comments and inside inline tags {@code } and
{@literal }.


Rationale: according to

the specification all javadoc block tags should be placed at the
beginning of a line. Tags that are not placed at the beginning are treated
as plain text. To recognize intentional tag placement to text area
it is better to escape the @ symbol, and all non-escaped
tags should be located at the beginning of the line. See NOTE section
for details on how to escape.
[Options]
tags, Specify the javadoc tags to process.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
SingleLineJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that a Javadoc block can fit in a single-line and doesn't
contain block tags. Javadoc comment that contains at least one block tag
should be formatted in a few lines.
[Options]
ignoreInlineTags, Control whether
inline tags must be ignored.
ignoredTags, Specify
block tags which are ignored by the check.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingWhitespaceAfterAsterisk
[Description]
Checks that there is at least one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
Although spaces after asterisks are optional in the Javadoc comments, their absence
makes the documentation difficult to read. It is the de facto standard to put at least
one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingLeadingAsterisk
[Description]
Checks if the javadoc has

leading asterisks

on each line.


The check does not require asterisks on the first line, nor on the last line
if it is blank. All other lines in a Javadoc should start with *,
including blank lines and code blocks.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Options]
offset, Specify how many spaces to use for new indentation level.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocContentLocation
[Description]
Checks that the Javadoc content begins from the same position
for all Javadoc comments in the project. Any leading asterisks and spaces
are not counted as the beginning of the content and are therefore ignored.


It is possible to enforce two different styles:



{@code first_line} - Javadoc content starts from the first line:



/** Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();



{@code second_line} - Javadoc content starts from the second line:



/**
* Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();
[Options]
location, Specify the policy on placement of the Javadoc content.
[Rule]
AtclauseOrder
[Description]
Checks the order of

javadoc block-tags or javadoc tags.


Note: Google used the term "at-clauses" for block tags in their guide till 2017-02-28.
[Options]
tagOrder, Specify the order by tags.
target, Specify block tags targeted.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
NonEmptyAtclauseDescription
[Description]
Checks that the block tag is followed by description.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
javadocTokens, javadoc tokens to check

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
