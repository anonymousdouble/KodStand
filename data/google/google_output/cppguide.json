As every C++\nprogrammer knows, the language has many powerful features, but\nthis power brings with it complexity, which in turn can make\ncode more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by\ndescribing in detail the dos and don'ts of writing C++\ncode. These rules exist to\nkeep  the code base manageable while still allowing\ncoders to use C++ language features productively.Style, also known as readability, is what we call\nthe conventions that govern our C++ code. The term Style is a\nbit of a misnomer, since these conventions cover far more than\njust source file formatting.\nMost open-source projects developed by\nGoogle conform to the requirements in this guide.\nNote that this guide is not a C++ tutorial: we assume that\nthe reader is familiar with the language.

                "description": "Why do we have this document?There are a few core goals that we believe this guide should\nserve. These are the fundamental whys that\nunderlie all of the individual rules. By bringing these ideas to\nthe fore, we hope to ground discussions and make it clearer to our\nbroader community why the rules are in place and why particular\ndecisions have been made. If you understand what goals each rule is\nserving, it should be clearer to everyone when a rule may be waived\n(some can be), and what sort of argument or alternative would be\nnecessary to change a rule in the guide.The goals of the style guide as we currently see them are as follows:\nStyle rules should pull their weight\nThe benefit of a style rule\nmust be large enough to justify asking all of our engineers to\nremember it. The benefit is measured relative to the codebase we would\nget without the rule, so a rule against a very harmful practice may\nstill have a small benefit if people are unlikely to do it\nanyway. This principle mostly explains the rules we don’t have, rather\nthan the rules we do: for example, goto contravenes many\nof the following principles, but is already vanishingly rare, so the Style\nGuide doesn’t discuss it.\nOptimize for the reader, not the writer\nOur codebase (and most individual components submitted to it) is\nexpected to continue for quite some time. As a result, more time will\nbe spent reading most of our code than writing it. We explicitly\nchoose to optimize for the experience of our average software engineer\nreading, maintaining, and debugging code in our codebase rather than\nease when writing said code.  \"Leave a trace for the reader\" is a\nparticularly common sub-point of this principle: When something\nsurprising or unusual is happening in a snippet of code (for example,\ntransfer of pointer ownership), leaving textual hints for the reader\nat the point of use is valuable (std::unique_ptr\ndemonstrates the ownership transfer unambiguously at the call\nsite). \nBe consistent with existing code\nUsing one style consistently through our codebase lets us focus on\nother (more important) issues. Consistency also allows for automation:\ntools that format your code or adjust your #includes only\nwork properly when your code is consistent with the expectations of\nthe tooling. In many cases, rules that are attributed to \"Be\nConsistent\" boil down to \"Just pick one and stop worrying about it\";\nthe potential value of allowing flexibility on these points is\noutweighed by the cost of having people argue over them. However,\nthere are limits to consistency; it is a good tie breaker when there\nis no clear technical argument, nor a long-term direction. It applies\nmore heavily locally (per file, or for a tightly-related set of\ninterfaces). Consistency should not generally be used as a\njustification to do things in an old style without considering the\nbenefits of the new style, or the tendency of the codebase to converge\non newer styles over time.\nBe consistent with the broader C++ community when appropriate\nConsistency with the way other organizations use C++ has value for\nthe same reasons as consistency within our code base. If a feature in\nthe C++ standard solves a problem, or if some idiom is widely known\nand accepted, that's an argument for using it. However, sometimes\nstandard features and idioms are flawed, or were just designed without\nour codebase's needs in mind. In those cases (as described below) it's\nappropriate to constrain or ban standard features.  In some cases we\nprefer a homegrown or third-party library over a library defined in\nthe C++ Standard, either out of perceived superiority or insufficient\nvalue to transition the codebase to the standard interface.\nAvoid surprising or dangerous constructs\nC++ has features that are more surprising or dangerous than one\nmight think at a glance. Some style guide restrictions are in place to\nprevent falling into these pitfalls. There is a high bar for style\nguide waivers on such restrictions, because waiving such rules often\ndirectly risks compromising program correctness.\n\nAvoid constructs that our average C++ programmer would find tricky\nor hard to maintain\nC++ has features that may not be generally appropriate because of\nthe complexity they introduce to the code. In widely used\ncode, it may be more acceptable to use\ntrickier language constructs, because any benefits of more complex\nimplementation are multiplied widely by usage, and the cost in understanding\nthe complexity does not need to be paid again when working with new\nportions of the codebase. When in doubt, waivers to rules of this type\ncan be sought by asking\nyour project leads. This is specifically\nimportant for our codebase because code ownership and team membership\nchanges over time: even if everyone that works with some piece of code\ncurrently understands it, such understanding is not guaranteed to hold a\nfew years from now.\nBe mindful of our scale\nWith a codebase of 100+ million lines and thousands of engineers,\nsome mistakes and simplifications for one engineer can become costly\nfor many. For instance it's particularly important to\navoid polluting the global namespace: name collisions across a\ncodebase of hundreds of millions of lines are difficult to work with\nand hard to avoid if everyone puts things into the global\nnamespace.\nConcede to optimization when necessary\nPerformance optimizations can sometimes be necessary and\nappropriate, even when they conflict with the other principles of this\ndocument.\nThe intent of this document is to provide maximal guidance with\nreasonable restriction. As always, common sense and good taste should\nprevail. By this we specifically refer to the established conventions\nof the entire Google C++ community, not just your personal preferences\nor those of your team. Be skeptical about and reluctant to use\nclever or unusual constructs: the absence of a prohibition is not the\nsame as a license to proceed.  Use your judgment, and if you are\nunsure, please don't hesitate to ask your project leads to get additional\ninput.",

More formally it\nmeans that the type has no user-defined or virtual destructor and that all bases\nand non-static members are trivially destructible.\nStatic function-local variables may use dynamic initialization.\nUse of dynamic initialization for static class member variables or variables at\nnamespace scope is discouraged, but allowed in limited circumstances; see below\nfor details.As a rule of thumb: a global variable satisfies these requirements if its\ndeclaration, considered in isolation, could be constexpr.Every object has a storage duration, which correlates with its\nlifetime. Objects with static storage duration live from the point of their\ninitialization until the end of the program. Such objects appear as variables at\nnamespace scope (\"global variables\"), as static data members of classes, or as\nfunction-local variables that are declared with the static\nspecifier. Function-local static variables are initialized when control first\npasses through their declaration; all other objects with static storage duration\nare initialized as part of program start-up. All objects with static storage\nduration are destroyed at program exit (which happens before unjoined threads\nare terminated).Initialization may be dynamic, which means that something\nnon-trivial happens during initialization. (For example, consider a constructor\nthat allocates memory, or a variable that is initialized with the current\nprocess ID.) The other kind of initialization is static\ninitialization. The two aren't quite opposites, though: static\ninitialization always happens to objects with static storage duration\n(initializing the object either to a given constant or to a representation\nconsisting of all bytes set to zero), whereas dynamic initialization happens\nafter that, if required.Global and static variables are very useful for a large number of\napplications: named constants, auxiliary data structures internal to some\ntranslation unit, command-line flags, logging, registration mechanisms,\nbackground infrastructure, etc.Global and static variables that use dynamic initialization or have\nnon-trivial destructors create complexity that can easily lead to hard-to-find\nbugs. Dynamic initialization is not ordered across translation units, and\nneither is destruction (except that destruction\nhappens in reverse order of initialization). When one initialization refers to\nanother variable with static storage duration, it is possible that this causes\nan object to be accessed before its lifetime has begun (or after its lifetime\nhas ended).

Support copying and/or\nmoving if these operations are clear and meaningful for your type.A movable type is one that can be initialized and assigned\nfrom temporaries.A copyable type is one that can be initialized or assigned from\nany other object of the same type (so is also movable by definition), with the\nstipulation that the value of the source does not change.\nstd::unique_ptr<int> is an example of a movable but not\ncopyable type (since the value of the source\nstd::unique_ptr<int> must be modified during assignment to\nthe destination). int and std::string are examples of\nmovable types that are also copyable. (For int, the move and copy\noperations are the same; for std::string, there exists a move operation\nthat is less expensive than a copy.)For user-defined types, the copy behavior is defined by the copy\nconstructor and the copy-assignment operator. Move behavior is defined by the\nmove constructor and the move-assignment operator, if they exist, or by the\ncopy constructor and the copy-assignment operator otherwise.The copy/move constructors can be implicitly invoked by the compiler\nin some situations, e.g., when passing objects by value.Objects of copyable and movable types can be passed and returned by value,\nwhich makes APIs simpler, safer, and more general. Unlike when passing objects\nby pointer or reference, there's no risk of confusion over ownership,\nlifetime, mutability, and similar issues, and no need to specify them in the\ncontract. It also prevents non-local interactions between the client and the\nimplementation, which makes them easier to understand, maintain, and optimize by\nthe compiler. Further, such objects can be used with generic APIs that\nrequire pass-by-value, such as most containers, and they allow for additional\nflexibility in e.g., type composition.Copy/move constructors and assignment operators are usually\neasier to define correctly than alternatives\nlike Clone(), CopyFrom() or Swap(),\nbecause they can be generated by the compiler, either implicitly or\nwith = default.  They are concise, and ensure\nthat all data members are copied. Copy and move\nconstructors are also generally more efficient, because they don't\nrequire heap allocation or separate initialization and assignment\nsteps, and they're eligible for optimizations such as\n\n\ncopy elision.Move operations allow the implicit and efficient transfer of\nresources out of rvalue objects. This allows a plainer coding style\nin some cases.Some types do not need to be copyable, and providing copy\noperations for such types can be confusing, nonsensical, or outright\nincorrect. Types representing singleton objects (Registerer),\nobjects tied to a specific scope (Cleanup), or closely coupled to\nobject identity (Mutex) cannot be copied meaningfully.\nCopy operations for base class types that are to be used\npolymorphically are hazardous, because use of them can lead to\nobject slicing.\nDefaulted or carelessly-implemented copy operations can be incorrect, and the\nresulting bugs can be confusing and difficult to diagnose.Copy constructors are invoked implicitly, which makes the\ninvocation easy to miss. This may cause confusion for programmers used to\nlanguages where pass-by-reference is conventional or mandatory. It may also\nencourage excessive copying, which can cause performance problems.Every class's public interface must make clear which copy and move\noperations the class supports. This should usually take the form of explicitly\ndeclaring and/or deleting the appropriate operations in the public\nsection of the declaration.Specifically, a copyable class should explicitly declare the copy\noperations, a move-only class should explicitly declare the move operations, and\na non-copyable/movable class should explicitly delete the copy operations. A\ncopyable class may also declare move operations in order to support efficient\nmoves. Explicitly declaring or deleting all four copy/move operations is\npermitted, but not required.

Overloaded operators are the idiomatic names\nfor certain operations (e.g., ==, <,\n=, and <<), and adhering to\nthose conventions can make user-defined types more readable\nand enable them to interoperate with libraries that expect\nthose names.User-defined literals are a very concise notation for\ncreating objects of user-defined types.\nProviding a correct, consistent, and unsurprising\n  set of operator overloads requires some care, and failure\n  to do so can lead to confusion and bugs.\nOveruse of operators can lead to obfuscated code,\n  particularly if the overloaded operator's semantics\n  don't follow convention.\nThe hazards of function overloading apply just as\n  much to operator overloading, if not more so.\nOperator overloads can fool our intuition into\n  thinking that expensive operations are cheap, built-in\n  operations.\nFinding the call sites for overloaded operators may\n  require a search tool that's aware of C++ syntax, rather\n  than e.g., grep.\nIf you get the argument type of an overloaded operator\n  wrong, you may get a different overload rather than a\n  compiler error. For example, foo < bar\n  may do one thing, while &foo < &bar\n  does something totally different.\nCertain operator overloads are inherently hazardous.\n  Overloading unary & can cause the same\n  code to have different meanings depending on whether\n  the overload declaration is visible. Overloads of\n  &&, ||, and ,\n  (comma) cannot match the evaluation-order semantics of the\n  built-in operators.\nOperators are often defined outside the class,\n  so there's a risk of different files introducing\n  different definitions of the same operator. If both\n  definitions are linked into the same binary, this results\n  in undefined behavior, which can manifest as subtle\n  run-time bugs.\nUser-defined literals (UDLs) allow the creation of new\n  syntactic forms that are unfamiliar even to experienced C++\n  programmers, such as \"Hello World\"sv as a\n  shorthand for std::string_view(\"Hello World\").\n  Existing notations are clearer, though less terse.\nBecause they can't be namespace-qualified, uses of UDLs also require\n  use of either using-directives (which we ban) or\n  using-declarations (which we ban in header files except\n  when the imported names are part of the interface exposed by the header\n  file in question).  Given that header files would have to avoid UDL\n  suffixes, we prefer to avoid having conventions for literals differ\n  between header files and source files.\n  \nDefine overloaded operators only if their meaning is\nobvious, unsurprising, and consistent with the corresponding\nbuilt-in operators. For example, use | as a\nbitwise- or logical-or, not as a shell-style pipe.Define operators only on your own types. More precisely,\ndefine them in the same headers, .cc files, and namespaces\nas the types they operate on. That way, the operators are available\nwherever the type is, minimizing the risk of multiple\ndefinitions. If possible, avoid defining operators as templates,\nbecause they must satisfy this rule for any possible template\narguments. If you define an operator, also define\nany related operators that make sense, and make sure they\nare defined consistently.Prefer to define non-modifying binary operators as\nnon-member functions.

Readers may also expect\nthe default's value to be fixed at the declaration instead\nof varying at each call.Function pointers are confusing in the presence of\ndefault arguments, since the function signature often\ndoesn't match the call signature. Adding\nfunction overloads avoids these problems.Default arguments are banned on virtual functions, where\nthey don't work properly, and in cases where the specified\ndefault might not evaluate to the same value depending on\nwhen it was evaluated. (For example, don't write void\nf(int n = counter++);.)In some other cases, default arguments can improve the\nreadability of their function declarations enough to\novercome the downsides above, so they are allowed.

Either they must make at least the\n  basic exception safety guarantee, or they must never\n  catch the exception and be happy with the program\n  terminating as a result.

C++\n  usually does this automatically but some situations\n  need an explicit up-cast, such as use of the\n  ?: operator.\nUse static_cast as the equivalent of a C-style cast\n  that does value conversion, when you need to\n  explicitly up-cast a pointer from a class to its superclass, or when\n  you need to explicitly cast a pointer from a superclass to a\n  subclass.  In this last case, you must be sure your object is\n  actually an instance of the subclass.\nUse const_cast to remove the\n  const qualifier (see const).\nUse reinterpret_cast to do unsafe conversions of\n  pointer types to and from integer and other pointer\n  types,\n  including void*. Use this\n  only if you know what you are doing and you understand the aliasing\n  issues. Also, consider dereferencing the pointer (without a cast) and\n  using std::bit_cast to cast the resulting value.\nUse std::bit_cast to interpret the raw bits of a\n  value using a different type of the same size (a type pun), such as\n  interpreting the bits of a double as\n  int64_t.\nSee the \nRTTI section for guidance on the use of\ndynamic_cast.",

Overload << for streaming only for types\nrepresenting values, and write only the user-visible value, not any\nimplementation details.Streams are the standard I/O abstraction in C++, as\nexemplified by the standard header <iostream>.\nThey are widely used in Google code, mostly for debug logging\nand test diagnostics.The << and >>\nstream operators provide an API for formatted I/O that\nis easily learned, portable, reusable, and extensible.\nprintf, by contrast, doesn't even support\nstd::string, to say nothing of user-defined types,\nand is very difficult to use portably.\nprintf also obliges you to choose among the\nnumerous slightly different versions of that function,\nand navigate the dozens of conversion specifiers.Streams provide first-class support for console I/O\nvia std::cin, std::cout,\nstd::cerr, and std::clog.\nThe C APIs do as well, but are hampered by the need to\nmanually buffer the input. \nStream formatting can be configured by mutating the\nstate of the stream. Such mutations are persistent, so\nthe behavior of your code can be affected by the entire\nprevious history of the stream, unless you go out of your\nway to restore it to a known state every time other code\nmight have touched it. User code can not only modify the\nbuilt-in state, it can add new state variables and behaviors\nthrough a registration system.\nIt is difficult to precisely control stream output, due\nto the above issues, the way code and data are mixed in\nstreaming code, and the use of operator overloading (which\nmay select a different overload than you expect).\nThe practice of building up output through chains\nof << operators interferes with\ninternationalization, because it bakes word order into the\ncode, and streams' support for localization is \nflawed.\nThe streams API is subtle and complex, so programmers must\ndevelop experience with it in order to use it effectively.\nResolving the many overloads of << is\nextremely costly for the compiler. When used pervasively in a\nlarge code base, it can consume as much as 20% of the parsing\nand semantic analysis time.\nUse streams only when they are the best tool for the job.\nThis is typically the case when the I/O is ad-hoc, local,\nhuman-readable, and targeted at other developers rather than\nend-users. Be consistent with the code around you, and with the\ncodebase as a whole; if there's an established tool for\nyour problem, use that tool instead.\nIn particular,\n\nlogging libraries are usually a better\nchoice than std::cerr or std::clog\nfor diagnostic output, and the libraries in\n\nabsl/strings\nor the equivalent are usually a\nbetter choice than std::stringstream.Avoid using streams for I/O that faces external users or\nhandles untrusted data. Instead, find and use the appropriate\ntemplating libraries to handle issues like internationalization,\nlocalization, and security hardening.If you do use streams, avoid the stateful parts of the\nstreams API (other than error state), such as imbue(),\nxalloc(), and register_callback().\nUse explicit formatting functions (such as\nabsl::StreamFormat()) rather than\nstream manipulators or formatting flags to control formatting\ndetails such as number base, precision, or padding.Overload << as a streaming operator\nfor your type only if your type represents a value, and\n<< writes out a human-readable string\nrepresentation of that value. Avoid exposing implementation\ndetails in the output of <<; if you need to print\nobject internals for debugging, use named functions instead\n(a method named DebugString() is the most common\nconvention).",

This causes the lambda's call operator\n    to be a function template instead of an ordinary function, with a separate\n    template parameter for each auto function parameter:\n    // Sort `vec` in decreasing order\nstd::sort(vec.begin(), vec.end(), [](auto lhs, auto rhs) { return lhs > rhs; });\n\nLambda init captures\nLambda captures can have explicit initializers, which can be used to\n    declare wholly new variables rather than only capturing existing ones:\n    [x = 42, y = \"foo\"] { ... }  // x is an int, and y is a const char*\n    This syntax doesn't allow the type to be specified; instead, it's deduced\n    using the rules for auto variables.\n  \nClass template argument deduction\nSee below.\nStructured bindings\nWhen declaring a tuple, struct, or array using auto, you can\n    specify names for the individual elements instead of a name for the whole\n    object; these names are called \"structured bindings\", and the whole\n    declaration is called a \"structured binding declaration\". This syntax\n    provides no way of specifying the type of either the enclosing object\n    or the individual names:\n    auto [iter, success] = my_map.insert({key, value});\nif (!success) {\n  iter->second = value;\n}\n    The auto can also be qualified with const,\n    &, and &&, but note that these qualifiers\n    technically apply to the anonymous tuple/struct/array, rather than the\n    individual bindings. The rules that determine the types of the bindings\n    are quite complex; the results tend to be unsurprising, except that\n    the binding types typically won't be references even if the declaration\n    declares a reference (but they will usually behave like references anyway).\n  \n(These summaries omit many details and caveats; see the links for further\n  information.)\nC++ type names can be long and cumbersome, especially when they\n    involve templates or namespaces.\nWhen a C++ type name is repeated within a single declaration or a\n    small code region, the repetition may not be aiding readability.\nIt is sometimes safer to let the type be deduced, since that avoids\n    the possibility of unintended copies or type conversions.\nC++ code is usually clearer when types are explicit,\n  especially when type deduction would depend on information from\n  distant parts of the code.

If you're using recursive template instantiations\nor type lists or metafunctions or expression templates, or relying on\nSFINAE or on the sizeof trick for detecting function\noverload resolution, then there's a good chance you've gone too\nfar.If you use template metaprogramming, you should expect to put\nconsiderable effort into minimizing and isolating the complexity. You\nshould hide metaprogramming as an implementation detail whenever\npossible, so that user-facing headers are readable, and you should\nmake sure that tricky code is especially well commented. You should\ncarefully document how the code is used, and you should say something\nabout what the \"generated\" code looks like. Pay extra attention to the\nerror messages that the compiler emits when users make mistakes.  The\nerror messages are part of your user interface, and your code should\nbe tweaked as necessary so that the error messages are understandable\nand actionable from a user point of view.",

This will make the argument\n  values self-describing.\nFor functions that have several configuration options, consider\n  defining a single class or struct to hold all the options\n  ,\n  and pass an instance of that.\n  This approach has several advantages. Options are referenced by name\n  at the call site, which clarifies their meaning. It also reduces\n  function argument count, which makes function calls easier to read and\n  write.

In particular, don't put more than one or two blank\nlines between functions, resist starting functions with a blank line,\ndon't end functions with a blank line, and be sparing with your use of\nblank lines. A blank line within a block of code serves like a\nparagraph break in prose: visually separating two thoughts.The basic principle is: The more code that fits on one screen, the\neasier it is to follow and understand the control flow of the\nprogram. Use whitespace purposefully to provide separation in that\nflow.Some rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be\nuseful:\nBlank lines at the beginning or end of a function\n  do not help readability.\nBlank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may\n  well help readability.\nA blank line before a comment line usually helps\n  readability — the introduction of a new comment suggests\n  the start of a new thought, and the blank line makes it clear\n  that the comment goes with the following thing instead of the\n  preceding.\nBlank lines immediately inside a declaration of a namespace or block of\n  namespaces may help readability by visually separating the load-bearing\n  content from the (largely non-semantic) organizational wrapper. Especially\n  when the first declaration inside the namespace(s) is preceded by a comment,\n  this becomes a special case of the previous rule, helping the comment to\n  \"attach\" to the subsequent declaration.\n",

                "description": " Windows\nprogrammers have developed their own set of coding\nconventions, mainly derived from the conventions in Windows\nheaders and other Microsoft code. We want to make it easy\nfor anyone to understand your code, so we have a single set\nof guidelines for everyone writing C++ on any platform.It is worth reiterating a few of the guidelines that\nyou might forget if you are used to the prevalent Windows\nstyle:\nDo not use Hungarian notation (for example, naming\n  an integer iNum). Use the Google naming\n  conventions, including the .cc extension\n  for source files.\nWindows defines many of its own synonyms for\n  primitive types, such as DWORD,\n  HANDLE, etc. It is perfectly acceptable,\n  and encouraged, that you use these types when calling\n  Windows API functions. Even so, keep as close as you\n  can to the underlying C++ types. For example, use\n  const TCHAR * instead of\n  LPCTSTR.\nWhen compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, set the\n  compiler to warning level 3 or higher, and treat all\n  warnings as errors.\nDo not use #pragma once; instead use\n  the standard Google include guards. The path in the\n  include guards should be relative to the top of your\n  project tree.\nIn fact, do not use any nonstandard extensions,\n  like #pragma and __declspec,\n  unless you absolutely must. Using\n  __declspec(dllimport) and\n  __declspec(dllexport) is allowed; however,\n  you must use them through macros such as\n  DLLIMPORT and DLLEXPORT, so\n  that someone can easily disable the extensions if they\n  share the code.\nHowever, there are just a few rules that we\noccasionally need to break on Windows:\nNormally we strongly discourage\n  the use of multiple implementation inheritance;\n  however, it is required when using COM and some ATL/WTL\n  classes. You may use multiple implementation\n  inheritance to implement COM or ATL/WTL classes and\n  interfaces.\nAlthough you should not use exceptions in your own\n  code, they are used extensively in the ATL and some\n  STLs, including the one that comes with Visual C++.\n  When using the ATL, you should define\n  _ATL_NO_EXCEPTIONS to disable exceptions.\n  You should investigate whether you can also disable\n  exceptions in your STL, but if not, it is OK to turn on\n  exceptions in the compiler. (Note that this is only to\n  get the STL to compile. You should still not write\n  exception handling code yourself.)\nThe usual way of working with precompiled headers\n  is to include a header file at the top of each source\n  file, typically with a name like StdAfx.h\n  or precompile.h. To make your code easier\n  to share with other projects, avoid including this file\n  explicitly (except in precompile.cc), and\n  use the /FI compiler option to include the\n  file automatically.\nResource headers, which are usually named\n  resource.h and contain only macros, do not\n  need to conform to these style guidelines.\n",
