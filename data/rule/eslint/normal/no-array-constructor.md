## Overview
Disallow `Array` constructors


ðŸ’¡ hasSuggestions

            Some problems reported by this rule are manually fixable by editor suggestions 



Use of the `Array` constructor to construct a new array is generally
discouraged in favor of array literal notation because of the single-argument
pitfall and because the `Array` global may be redefined. The exception is when
the Array constructor is used to intentionally create sparse arrays of a
specified size by giving the constructor a single numeric argument.
## Rule Details
This rule disallows `Array` constructors.
Examples of incorrect code for this rule:


```json
/*eslint no-array-constructor: "error"*/

Array();

Array(0, 1, 2);

new Array(0, 1, 2);

Array(...args);
```
Examples of correct code for this rule:


```json
/*eslint no-array-constructor: "error"*/

Array(500);

new Array(someOtherArray.length);

[0, 1, 2];

const createArray = Array => new Array();
```
## When Not To Use It
This rule enforces a nearly universal stylistic concern. That being said, this
rule may be disabled if the constructor style is preferred.
