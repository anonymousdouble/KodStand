Analyze the following CheckStyle Rule, please parse the CheckStyle Rule using the given Grammar to make its semantics clear and correct. CheckStyle Rule consists of Description and configurable Options. 

1. Analyze whether each sentence of Description of CheckStyle Rule is a rule and then classify it as mandatory or optional. If the rule is same as an option, do not need to parse it as a rule. If the rule is subjective, do not classify it as a rule. 
2. Analyze whether each option is a rule. If option is a configurable term, using {{OptionName}} to represent the term. If the option is to configure violation messages or reporting granularity, do not classify it as a rule. If the option is a rule, parse rule for each value of the option.
3. When parsing a rule using the given Grammar, pay attention to map to suitable formal Java term and select appropriate real operator characters. 

CheckStyle Rule:
Rulename
OneTopLevelClass
Description

Checks that each top-level class, interface, enum
or annotation resides in a source file of its own.
Official description of a 'top-level' term:
7.6. Top Level Type Declarations.
If file doesn't contain public class, interface, enum or annotation,
top-level type is the first type in file.

Grammar:
RuleSet ::= Rule1 [And|Or|; Rule2]* # And means should satisfy Rule1 and Rule2. Or means can satisfy Rule1 or Rule2. ; means Rule1,Rule2 belongs to diffent groups
Rule ::= {{'Optional'| 'Mandatory'}} [ ['Order' of | 'Number' of] TermList [Operator TermList]* | Rule1 '->' Rule2] [ExceptionRule] #'Order' of  means order rule, 'Number' of means numberConstraint, Rule1 '->' Rule2 means if Rule1 then Rule2
ExceptionRule ::= 'Except ' TermList | Rule # means rules not applied to TermList | Rule # means rules not applied to TermList | Rule
Operator = 'is'| 'is not' | '>=' | '<=' | '=' | '!=' | 'for' | 'not for' | 'before' | 'not before' | 'after' | 'not after' | 'between' | 'not between' | 'have' | 'not have' | 'Add' | 'Sub' | 'Mult' | MatMult | 'Div' | 'Mod' | 'Pow' | 'LShift' | 'RShift' | 'BitOr' | 'BitXor' | 'BitAnd' | 'FloorDiv'
TermList ::= Term [, Term]*
Modifier ::= 'some' | 'each' | 'all' | 'except' | 'first' | 'last' | ...
Term :: = JavaTerm | Modifier* Term | Term of Term
JavaTerm means the formal expression using such format [XXX] "XXX" represent a JavaTerm


For Example, Analyze the following CheckStyle Rule, please parse the CheckStyle Rule using the given Grammar to make its semantics clear and correct. CheckStyle Rule consists of Description and configurable Options. 

CheckStyle Rule:
Rulename:
NeedBraces

Description
Checks for braces around code blocks.

Options:
allowEmptyLoopBody, Allow loops with empty bodies., boolean, false
allowSingleLineStatement, Allow single-line statements without braces., boolean, false
tokens, tokens to check, subset of tokens

Final RuleSet Representation:
Basic Rule:
{{tokens}} has [Brace] 

Option Rule:
allowEmptyLoopBody option:
False: Mandatory: [body] of {{tokens}} is not [Null]
True: Optional: [body] of {{tokens}} is [Null]

allowSingleLineStatement option:
False: Mandatory: Number of [statement] of [body] of [tokens] is 1 -> [tokens] has [Brace] 
True: Optional: Number of [statement] of [body] of [tokens] is 1 -> [tokens] not has [Brace]

=======================================================
Based on the provided CheckStyle Rule for "OneTopLevelClass," let's analyze it according to the given Grammar:

1. Description Analysis:
- The description provided for the "OneTopLevelClass" rule is not explicitly divided into separate rules. It provides an explanation of what the rule checks for, which is that each top-level class, interface, enum, or annotation should reside in a source file of its own. This description does not contain specific mandatory or optional rules.

2. Options Analysis:
- The "OneTopLevelClass" rule does not have configurable options to parse as rules. The rule itself defines the behavior that needs to be enforced, without additional configurable options.

3. RuleSet Representation:
- Since the description does not contain specific rules to parse, the RuleSet representation for the "OneTopLevelClass" rule would be straightforward:
  
Basic Rule:
- Ensure that each top-level class, interface, enum, or annotation resides in a source file of its own.

This rule does not have configurable options to represent as additional rules.

In summary, the "OneTopLevelClass" rule enforces the practice of having each top-level class, interface, enum, or annotation in its own source file, without providing configurable options for further customization.
