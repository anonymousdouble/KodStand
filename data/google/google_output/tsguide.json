Such is the case with conversion of enums to booleans; in particular, by default, the first declared enum value is falsy (because it is 0) while the others are truthy, which is likely to be unexpected. Readers of code that uses an enum value may not even know whether it's the first declared value or not.\nUsing string concatenation to cast to string is discouraged, as we check that operands to the plus operator are of matching types.\nCode must use `Number()` to parse numeric values, and must check its return for `NaN` values explicitly, unless failing to parse is impossible from context.\nNote: `Number('')` , `Number('')` , and `Number('\\t')` would return `0` instead of `NaN` . `Number('Infinity')` and `Number('-Infinity')` would return `Infinity` and `-Infinity` respectively.

They come with a number of drawbacks though:\nCompared to explicitly specifying properties and type relations (e.g. using interfaces and extension, see below for an example), type operators require the reader to mentally evaluate the type expression. This can make programs substantially harder to read, in particular combined with type inference and expressions crossing file boundaries. \nMapped & conditional types' evaluation model, in particular when combined with type inference, is underspecified, not always well understood, and often subject to change in TypeScript compiler versions. Code can accidentally compile or seem to give the right results. This increases future support cost of code using type operators. \nMapped & conditional types are most powerful when deriving types from complex and/or inferred types. On the flip side, this is also when they are most prone to create hard to understand and maintain programs. \nSome language tooling does not work well with these type system features. E.g. your IDE's find references (and thus rename property refactoring) will not find properties in a `Pick<T,Keys>` type, and Code Search won't hyperlink them.\nThe style recommendation is:\nAlways use the simplest type construct that can possibly express your code. \nA little bit of repetition or verbosity is often much cheaper than the long term cost of complex type expressions. \nMapped & conditional types may be used, subject to these considerations.\nFor example, TypeScript's builtin `Pick<T,Keys>` type allows creating a new type by subsetting another type `T` , but simple interface extension can often be easier to understand.",

Evaluate your style guide proposal against the following:\nCode should avoid patterns that are known to cause problems, especially for users new to the language. \nCode across projects should be consistent across irrelevant variations. \nWhen there are two options that are equivalent in a superficial way, we should consider choosing one just so we don't divergently evolve for no reason and avoid pointless debates in code reviews. \nExamples: \nThe capitalization style of names. \n`xasT` syntax vs the equivalent `<T>x` syntax (disallowed). \n`Array<[number,number]>` vs `[number,number][]` . \nCode should be maintainable in the long term. \nCode usually lives longer than the original author works on it, and the TypeScript team must keep all of Google working into the future. \nExamples: \nWe use software to automate changes to code, so code is autoformatted so it's easy for software to meet whitespace rules. \nWe require a single set of compiler flags, so a given TS library can be written assuming a specific set of flags, and users can always safely use a shared library. \nCode must import the libraries it uses ( strict deps ) so that a refactor in a dependency doesn't change the dependencies of its users. \nWe ask users to write tests. Without tests we cannot have confidence that changes that we make to the language, don't break users. \nCode reviewers should be focused on improving the quality of the code, not enforcing arbitrary rules. \nIf it's possible to implement your rule as an automated check that is often a good sign. This also supports principle 3. \nIf it really just doesn't matter that much -- if it's an obscure corner of the language or if it avoids a bug that is unlikely to occur -- it's probably worth leaving out.\nNamespace imports are often called 'module imports' ↩ \nnamed imports are sometimes called 'destructuring imports' because they use similar syntax to destructuring assignments. ↩"
