2.2 File encoding: UTF-8
Source files are encoded in UTF-8.

### Step 1: Determine if each sentence is a rule and classify it

1. ""Source files are encoded in UTF-8.""
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it specifies a required encoding format for source files.

### Step 2: Parse the rule using the given Grammar

#### Rule Analysis:
- The rule specifies that source files must be encoded in UTF-8.
- This can be mapped to a formal Java term for source files and encoding.

#### Formal Representation:
- JavaTerm for source files: `[SourceFile]`
- JavaTerm for encoding: `[Encoding]`
- Operator for specifying the encoding: `is`

#### Final RuleSet Representation:
Mandatory: [Encoding] of [SourceFile] is [UTF-8]

Java 专有名词 line terminator sequence 和  whitespace character，列出他们的all values


在 Java 中，""line terminator sequence"" 和 ""whitespace character"" 是两个特定的术语，它们的值如下：
Line Terminator Sequence（行终止序列）:
在 Java 中，行终止序列表示一行代码的结束符号。
Java 中的行终止序列有两种形式：
Carriage Return (CR): \r （十六进制表示为 0x0D）
Line Feed (LF): \n （十六进制表示为 0x0A）
一般情况下，Unix 和 Linux 系统使用 LF 作为行终止符，而 Windows 系统使用 CRLF（\r\n）作为行终止符。
Whitespace Character（空白字符）:
在 Java 中，空白字符指的是在源代码中用于分隔其他标记的字符，但在语义上不产生实际效果。
Java 中的空白字符包括：
Space（空格符）: （ASCII码为 0x20）
Tab（制表符）: \t （ASCII码为 0x09）
Line Feed（换行符）: \n （ASCII码为 0x0A）
Carriage Return（回车符）: \r （ASCII码为 0x0D）

Google Java Style Guide:
2.3.2 Special escape sequences
For any character that has a special escape sequence ( `\b` , `\t` , `\n` , `\f` , `\r` , `\""` , `\'` and `\\` ), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. `\012` ) or Unicode (e.g. `\u000a` ) escape.

### Step 1: Analyze whether each sentence is a rule and classify it as mandatory or optional.

1. **Sentence:** ""For any character that has a special escape sequence ( `\b` , `\t` , `\n` , `\f` , `\r` , `\""` , `\'` and `\\` ), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. `\012` ) or Unicode (e.g. `\u000a` ) escape.""

### Step 2: Parse the rule using the given Grammar.

#### Rule Breakdown:
- **Condition:** For any character that has a special escape sequence.
- **Action:** That sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal or Unicode escape.

#### Mapping to Formal Java Terms:
- **Special escape sequences:** `\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\f`, `\r`, `\""`, `\'`, `\\`
- **Octal escape:** `\012`
- **Unicode escape:** `\u000a`

#### Final RuleSet Representation:
```plaintext
Mandatory: [SpecialEscapeSequence] is used

### Explanation:
- **Mandatory:** This rule is mandatory as it specifies a strict requirement.
- **[SpecialEscapeSequence] is used:** This indicates that the special escape sequences must be used.
- **[SpecialEscapeSequence] is not [OctalEscape]:** This indicates that the special escape sequences should not be replaced by octal escapes.
- **[SpecialEscapeSequence] is not [UnicodeEscape]:** This indicates that the special escape sequences should not be replaced by Unicode escapes.

Google Java Style Guide:
3.1 License or copyright information, if present
If license or copyright information belongs in a file, it belongs here.

### Step 1: Determine if each sentence is a rule and classify it

1. ""If license or copyright information belongs in a file, it belongs here.""
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it specifies a requirement that must be followed if the condition is met.

### Step 2: Parse the rule using the given Grammar

#### Rule Analysis:
- The rule specifies that if certain information (license or copyright) is present in a file, it must be placed in a specific location (here).
- This can be represented as a conditional rule: if a condition is met, then a specific action must be taken.

#### Mapping to Formal Java Terms:
- ""license or copyright information"" can be represented as [LicenseInfo] or [CopyrightInfo].
- ""file"" can be represented as [File].
- ""here"" can be represented as [Header] (assuming ""here"" refers to the top of the file).

#### Selecting Appropriate Real Operator Characters:
- The condition ""if present"" can be represented using the ""have"" operator.
- The action ""belongs here"" can be represented using the ""is"" operator.

### Final RuleSet Representation:

```plaintext
Mandatory: [File] have [LicenseInfo] -> [LicenseInfo] is [Header]
Or
Mandatory: [File] have [CopyrightInfo] -> [CopyrightInfo] is [Header]

### Explanation:
- The first rule states that if a file has license information, then the license information must be in the header.
- The second rule states that if a file has copyright information, then the copyright information must be in the header.

Rule Description

The rule consists of:
STATIC group. This group sets the ordering of static imports.
SAME_PACKAGE(n) group. This group sets the ordering of the same package imports. Imports are considered on SAME_PACKAGE group if n first domains in package name and import name are identical:
Rules are configured as a comma-separated ordered list.
Note: '###' group separator is deprecated (in favor of a comma-separated list), but is currently supported for backward compatibility.
To set RegExps for THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE and STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE groups use thirdPartyPackageRegExp and standardPackageRegExp options.
Pretty often one import can match more than one group. For example, static import from standard package or regular expressions are configured to allow one import match multiple groups. In this case, group will be assigned according to priorities:
STATIC has top priority
SAME_PACKAGE has second priority
STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE and SPECIAL_IMPORTS will compete using ""best match"" rule: longer matching substring wins; in case of the same length, lower position of matching substring wins; if position is the same, order of rules in configuration solves the puzzle.
THIRD_PARTY has the least priority

","The Extracted Final Ruleset Description is:

```
Mandatory: [StaticImport] is not [StaticNestedClass]
And

```","Let's analyze the provided Google Java Style Guide section using the given Grammar.

Google Java Style Guide:
3.3.4 No static import for classes
Static import is not used for static nested classes. They are imported with normal imports.

### Step 1: Determine if each sentence is a rule and classify it as mandatory or optional.

1. ""Static import is not used for static nested classes.""
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it specifies a restriction that must be followed.

2. ""They are imported with normal imports.""
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it specifies the correct way to import static nested classes.

### Step 2: Parse the rules using the given Grammar.

#### Rule 1:
""Static import is not used for static nested classes.""

- This rule can be represented as:
  ```
  Mandatory: [StaticImport] is not [StaticNestedClass]
  ```

#### Rule 2:
""They are imported with normal imports.""

- This rule can be represented as:
  ```
  Mandatory: [StaticNestedClass] have [NormalImport]
  ```

### Final RuleSet Representation:

```
Mandatory: [StaticImport] is not [StaticNestedClass]
And
Mandatory: [StaticNestedClass] have [NormalImport]
```

### Explanation:

- The first rule specifies that static imports should not be used for static nested classes.
- The second rule specifies that static nested classes should be imported using normal imports.

By following these rules, the semantics of the style guide section are made clear and correct according to the given Grammar.","the type of import of static nested classes cannot be static

Class is static and nested  -> 
Import of class is not static

### Google Java Style Guide:
**3.4.1 Exactly one top-level class declaration**
Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.

### Analysis:
1. **Sentence 1: ""Exactly one top-level class declaration""**
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it specifies an exact constraint.

2. **Sentence 2: ""Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.""**
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it specifies a strict requirement.

### Parsing the Rule using the Given Grammar:
Let's break down the rules and map them to suitable formal Java terms and operators.

#### Rule 1:
- **Sentence 1: ""Exactly one top-level class declaration""**
  - This can be interpreted as a number constraint on the top-level class declarations in a source file.
  - Formal Java Term: `[TopLevelClassDeclaration]`
  - Operator: `=`
  - Number: `1`

#### Rule 2:
- **Sentence 2: ""Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.""**
  - This can be interpreted as a constraint that each top-level class must be in a separate source file.
  - Formal Java Term: `[TopLevelClass]`
  - Operator: `is`
  - Term: `[SourceFile]`

### Final RuleSet Representation:
```plaintext
Mandatory: [Number] of [TopLevelClassDeclaration] = 1
And
Mandatory: [TopLevelClass] is [SourceFile]
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1**: There must be exactly one top-level class declaration in a source file.
- **Rule 2**: Each top-level class must reside in its own source file.

2. **Sentence 2**: ""However, there's no single correct recipe for how to do it; different classes may order their contents in different ways.""
   - This is a subjective statement, not a rule.

3. **Sentence 3**: ""What is important is that each class uses some logical order, which its maintainer could explain if asked.""

#### 4 Formatting
**Terminology Note:**
- Block-like construct refers to the body of a class, method, or constructor.
- Note that, by Section 4.8.3.1 on array initializers, any array initializer may optionally be treated as if it were a block-like construct.

### Analysis:

1. **Terminology Note:**
   - This is not a rule but a definition to clarify the term ""block-like construct.""
   - No classification as mandatory or optional is needed.

2. **Note on Array Initializers:**
   - This is an informative note and not a rule.
   - It states that array initializers may optionally be treated as block-like constructs.
   - Since it is subjective and provides an optional treatment, it is not classified as a rule.

### Parsing the Rule Using the Given Grammar:

Since the provided text does not contain explicit rules but rather definitions and notes, there are no rules to parse using the given grammar. However, for completeness, let's consider how we might represent the optional treatment of array initializers as block-like constructs if it were to be formalized as a rule.

### Hypothetical Rule Representation:

If we were to formalize the optional treatment of array initializers as block-like constructs, it might look something like this:

**Hypothetical Rule:**
- Optional: [ArrayInitializer] is [BlockLikeConstruct]

### Final RuleSet Representation:

Since the provided text does not contain explicit rules, there is no RuleSet to represent. However, if we were to include the hypothetical rule, it would be:

```
Optional: [ArrayInitializer] is [BlockLikeConstruct]

### Summary:

- The provided section of the Google Java Style Guide does not contain explicit rules but rather definitions and notes.
- No rules are classified as mandatory or optional.
- A hypothetical rule for treating array initializers as block-like constructs is provided for completeness.

### Google Java Style Guide:
#### 4.1.3 Empty blocks: may be concise
An empty block or block-like construct may be in K & R style (as described in Section 4.1.2). Alternatively, it may be closed immediately after it is opened, with no characters or line break in between (`{}`), unless it is part of a multi-block statement (one that directly contains multiple blocks: `if/else` or `try/catch/finally`).

Examples:

// This is equally acceptable
void doNothingElse() {

// This is not acceptable: No concise empty blocks in a multi-block statement

```

### Analysis:
1. **Rule Identification and Classification:**
   - **Sentence 1:** ""An empty block or block-like construct may be in K & R style (as described in Section 4.1.2).""
     - This is an optional rule.
   - **Sentence 2:** ""Alternatively, it may be closed immediately after it is opened, with no characters or line break in between (`{}`), unless it is part of a multi-block statement (one that directly contains multiple blocks: `if/else` or `try/catch/finally`).""
     - This is an optional rule with an exception.

2. **Parsing the Rule using the Given Grammar:**
   - **Rule 1:** Optional: [EmptyBlock] may be in [KRStyle]
   - **Rule 2:** Optional: [EmptyBlock] may be [ClosedImmediately] with no [Characters] or [LineBreak] in between

The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.
Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks. For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those lines after the first. Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line, its indentation will not take effect. All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.","arrayInitIndent

   - ""Each statement is followed by a line break."" This is a rule.

2. **Classify the rule as mandatory or optional:**
   - The rule is stated without any subjective language, so it is mandatory.

### Explanation:
1. **Column Limit Rule:**
   - **Mandatory:** Java code must have a column limit of 100 characters.
   - **Mandatory:** Any line exceeding this limit must be line-wrapped.
   - **Optional:** If using fullwidth characters, you may choose to wrap the line earlier.

2. **Exceptions:**
   - **Mandatory:** Lines with long URLs in Javadoc or long JSNI method references are exceptions.
   - **Mandatory:** `package` and `import` statements are exceptions.
   - **Mandatory:** Command lines in comments that may be copied-and-pasted into a shell are exceptions.
   - **Mandatory:** Very long identifiers are exceptions, and the wrapping for the surrounding code should be as produced by google-java-format.

### Analysis and Classification of Rules

1. **The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a higher syntactic level.**
   - This is a subjective guideline, not a rule.

2. **When a line is broken at a non-assignment operator the break comes before the symbol.**
   - This is a rule and it is mandatory.

3. **This also applies to the following ""operator-like"" symbols:**
   - **the dot separator ( `.` )**
   - **the two colons of a method reference ( `::` )**
   - **an ampersand in a type bound ( `<TextendsFoo&Bar>` )**
   - **a pipe in a catch block ( `catch(FooException|BarExceptione)` ).**
   - These are specific cases of the previous rule, making it more explicit.

4. **When a line is broken at an assignment operator the break typically comes after the symbol, but either way is acceptable.**

   - This is a specific case of the previous rule, making it more explicit.

6. **A method or constructor name stays attached to the open parenthesis ( `(` ) that follows it.**
   - This is a rule and it is mandatory.

7. **A comma ( `,` ) stays attached to the token that precedes it.**
   - This is a rule and it is mandatory.

8. **A line is never broken adjacent to the arrow in a lambda, except that a break may come immediately after the arrow if the body of the lambda consists of a single unbraced expression.**
   - This is a rule and it is mandatory with an exception.

9. **Note: The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear code, not necessarily code that fits in the smallest number of lines.**

### Explanation

1. **Line breaks before non-assignment operators and specific operator-like symbols:**
   - This rule ensures that line breaks occur before non-assignment operators and specific symbols like dot separators, method reference colons, type bound ampersands, and catch block pipes.

2. **Line breaks after assignment operators and enhanced for colons:**
   - This rule allows flexibility in breaking lines after assignment operators and enhanced for colons, making it optional.

3. **Method or constructor names before open parenthesis:**
   - This rule mandates that method or constructor names should stay attached to the open parenthesis that follows them.

4. **Commas before preceding tokens:**
   - This rule mandates that commas should stay attached to the token that precedes them.

5. **Line breaks not before lambda arrows, with an exception:**
   - This rule mandates that line breaks should not occur adjacent to lambda arrows, except when the lambda body consists of a single unbraced expression, in which case a break may come immediately after the arrow.

The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.
Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks. For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those lines after the first. Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line, its indentation will not take effect. All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.","arrayInitIndent

Horizontal alignment is the practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.
This practice is permitted, but is never required by Google Style. It is not even required to maintain horizontal alignment in places where it was already used.

#### 4.6.3 Horizontal alignment: never required
**Terminology Note:**
Horizontal alignment is the practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.
This practice is permitted, but is never required by Google Style. It is not even required to maintain horizontal alignment in places where it was already used.
Here is an example without alignment, then using alignment:
```java
private int x; // this is fine
private Color color; // this too

private int   x;      // permitted, but future edits
private Color color;  // may leave it unaligned
```
**Tip:**
Alignment can aid readability, but it creates problems for future maintenance. Consider a future change that needs to touch just one line. This change may leave the formerly-pleasing formatting mangled, and that is allowed. More often it prompts the coder (perhaps you) to adjust whitespace on nearby lines as well, possibly triggering a cascading series of reformattings. That one-line change now has a ""blast radius."" This can at worst result in pointless busywork, but at best it still corrupts version history information, slows down reviewers and exacerbates merge conflicts.

```","Let's analyze the provided Google Java Style Guide section 5.2.8 and parse it using the given Grammar.

### Google Java Style Guide:
**5.2.8 Type variable names**
- Each type variable is named in one of two styles:
  - A single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such as `E`, `T`, `X`, `T2`)
  - A name in the form used for classes (see Section 5.2.2, Class names), followed by the capital letter `T` (examples: `RequestT`, `FooBarT`).

### Analysis:
1. **Rule Identification and Classification:**
   - **Sentence 1:** ""Each type variable is named in one of two styles:"" 
     - This is an introductory statement and not a rule.
   - **Sentence 2:** ""A single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such as `E`, `T`, `X`, `T2`)""
     - This is a rule and it is mandatory.
   - **Sentence 3:** ""A name in the form used for classes (see Section 5.2.2, Class names), followed by the capital letter `T` (examples: `RequestT`, `FooBarT`).""
     - This is a rule and it is mandatory.

2. **Parsing the Rules using the Given Grammar:**
   - **Rule 1:** A single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral.
     - Formal Java Term: `[TypeVariable]`
     - Grammar Representation:
       ```
       Mandatory: [TypeVariable] is [CapitalLetter]
       Or
       Mandatory: [TypeVariable] is [CapitalLetter][Numeral]
       ```
   - **Rule 2:** A name in the form used for classes, followed by the capital letter `T`.
     - Formal Java Term: `[TypeVariable]`
     - Grammar Representation:
       ```
       Mandatory: [TypeVariable] is [ClassName] + ""T""
       ```

### Final RuleSet Representation:
```
Mandatory: [TypeVariable] is [CapitalLetter]
Or
Mandatory: [TypeVariable] is [CapitalLetter][Numeral]
;
Mandatory: [TypeVariable] is [ClassName] + ""T""
```

### Explanation:
- The first part of the rule set specifies that a type variable can be a single capital letter or a single capital letter followed by a numeral.
- The second part of the rule set specifies that a type variable can also be a class name followed by the capital letter `T`.

This representation ensures that the semantics of the style guide are clear and correctly mapped to formal Java terms using the provided grammar.","type variable name starts A capital letter, follow/not follow a single numeral

### Google Java Style Guide:
**6.3 Static members: qualified using class**
When a reference to a static class member must be qualified, it is qualified with that class's name, not with a reference or expression of that class's type.
```java
Foo aFoo = ...;
Foo.aStaticMethod(); // good
aFoo.aStaticMethod(); // bad
somethingThatYieldsAFoo().aStaticMethod(); // very bad
```

### Analysis:

1. **Identify Rules and Classify:**
   - **Rule:** ""When a reference to a static class member must be qualified, it is qualified with that class's name, not with a reference or expression of that class's type.""
     - **Classification:** Mandatory (This is a clear directive on how static members should be referenced.)

2. **Parse the Rule using the Given Grammar:**
   - **Formal Java Terms:**
     - `StaticMemberReference`: A reference to a static class member.
     - `ClassName`: The name of the class.
     - `ReferenceOrExpression`: A reference or expression of the class's type.

   - **Operators:**
     - `is`: Used to indicate qualification.

### Final RuleSet Representation:

```plaintext
Mandatory: [StaticMemberReference] is [ClassName]
Except [StaticMemberReference] is [ReferenceOrExpression]
```

### Explanation:
- **Mandatory:** This rule mandates that any reference to a static class member must be qualified using the class's name.
- **Exception:** The rule explicitly states that the qualification should not be done using a reference or expression of the class's type.

### Example Code Analysis:
```java
Foo aFoo = ...;
Foo.aStaticMethod(); // good
aFoo.aStaticMethod(); // bad
somethingThatYieldsAFoo().aStaticMethod(); // very bad
```
- `Foo.aStaticMethod();` is correct because it qualifies the static member using the class name `Foo`.
- `aFoo.aStaticMethod();` is incorrect because it uses a reference `aFoo` to qualify the static member.
- `somethingThatYieldsAFoo().aStaticMethod();` is also incorrect because it uses an expression `somethingThatYieldsAFoo()` to qualify the static member.

By following the parsed rule, developers can ensure that static members are always referenced in a consistent and correct manner, adhering to the Google Java Style Guide.","Qualified Reference to a static class member

- **Mandatory: [Object.finalize] is not [Override]**
  - This rule states that `Object.finalize` should not be overridden, which is a direct interpretation of ""Don't do it.""

- **Or**
  - This operator indicates that the following rule is an alternative condition.

- **Mandatory: [Object.finalize] is [Override] -> [Read] ""Effective Java Item 8"" -> [Object.finalize] is not [Override]**
  - This rule states that if `Object.finalize` is overridden, the developer must first read ""Effective Java Item 8"" and then still not override `Object.finalize`.

- Tip: Don't do it. If you absolutely must, first read and understand Effective Java Item 8, ""Avoid finalizers and cleaners"" very carefully, and then don't do it.

### Analysis:

1. **It is extremely rare to override `Object.finalize`.**
   - This sentence is more of an observation or a subjective statement rather than a rule. Therefore, it is not classified as a rule.

2. **Tip: Don't do it.**
   - This is a directive and can be considered a rule. It is mandatory because it strongly advises against using finalizers.

3. **If you absolutely must, first read and understand Effective Java Item 8, ""Avoid finalizers and cleaners"" very carefully, and then don't do it.**
   - This is a conditional directive. It suggests that even if you must use finalizers, you should read and understand a specific resource first. However, it ends with a strong recommendation not to use finalizers anyway. This can be considered a mandatory rule with a conditional exception.

  - This rule states that `Object.finalize` should not be overridden, which is a direct interpretation of ""Don't do it.""

- **Or**
  - This operator indicates that the following rule is an alternative condition.

- **Mandatory: [Object.finalize] is [Override] -> [Read] ""Effective Java Item 8"" -> [Object.finalize] is not [Override]**
  - This rule states that if `Object.finalize` is overridden, the developer must first read ""Effective Java Item 8"" and then still not override `Object.finalize`. This captures the conditional directive provided in the style guide.

By parsing the style guide in this manner, we ensure that the semantics are clear and correctly mapped to formal Java terms and appropriate operators.","Not override `Object.finalize` method
not override finalize method
暗含了method name is not  finalize

""Finalizers"" refers to the finalize method in Java, which is a special method invoked by the garbage collector before reclaiming the memory occupied by an object.
""Override"" means providing a specific implementation for a method in a subclass that is already present in its superclass. In this case, it refers to providing a custom implementation for the finalize method in a class.

Checks that there is no method finalize with zero parameters.
See Object.finalize()
Rationale: Finalizers are unpredictable, often dangerous, and generally unnecessary. Their use can cause erratic behavior, poor performance, and portability problems. For more information for the finalize method and its issues, see Effective Java: Programming Language Guide Third Edition by Joshua Bloch, §8.

Checks for missing Javadoc comments for a method or constructor. The scope to verify is specified using the Scope class and defaults to Scope.PUBLIC. To verify another scope, set property scope to a different scope.
Javadoc is not required on a method that is tagged with the @Override annotation. However, under Java 5 it is not possible to mark a method required for an interface (this was corrected under Java 6). Hence, Checkstyle supports using the convention of using a single {@inheritDoc} tag instead of all the other tags.
For getters and setters for the property allowMissingPropertyJavadoc, the methods must match exactly the structures below.

### Google Java Style Guide:
#### 7.3.1 Exception: self-explanatory members
1. Javadoc is optional for ""simple, obvious"" members like `getFoo()`, in cases where there really and truly is nothing else worthwhile to say but ""Returns the foo"".
2. Important: it is not appropriate to cite this exception to justify omitting relevant information that a typical reader might need to know. For example, for a method named `getCanonicalName`, don't omit its documentation (with the rationale that it would say only `/**Returns the canonical name.*/`) if a typical reader may have no idea what the term ""canonical name"" means!

### Analysis:
1. **Sentence 1**: ""Javadoc is optional for 'simple, obvious' members like `getFoo()`, in cases where there really and truly is nothing else worthwhile to say but 'Returns the foo'.""
   - **Rule**: Yes
   - **Classification**: Optional
   - **Formal Java Terms**: Javadoc, Method

### Explanation:
1. **Optional Rule**:
   - Javadoc is optional for methods that are simple and obvious, where the only thing to say is ""Returns the foo"".
   - This is represented as:

### Google Java Style Guide:
**7.3.2 Exception: overrides**
Javadoc is not always present on a method that overrides a supertype method.

### Analysis:

1. **Determine if the sentence is a rule:**
   - The sentence ""Javadoc is not always present on a method that overrides a supertype method"" is a rule.
   
2. **Classify the rule as mandatory or optional:**
   - The rule is not mandatory because it states that Javadoc is not always required. Therefore, it is an optional rule.

3. **Parse the rule using the given Grammar:**
   - The rule specifies an exception for methods that override a supertype method.

### Final RuleSet Representation:

```plaintext
Optional: [Javadoc] have [Method]
Except [Method] of [Override]
```

### Explanation:
- **Optional:** This indicates that the rule is not mandatory.
- **[Javadoc] have [Method]:** This part of the rule states that Javadoc is generally associated with methods.
- **Except [Method] of [Override]:** This specifies the exception to the rule, indicating that methods which override a supertype method do not always need Javadoc.

1. Other classes and members have Javadoc as needed or desired.

3. Non-required Javadoc is not strictly required to follow the formatting rules of Sections 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.2, though it is of course recommended.

### Analysis:

#### Sentence 1:
""Other classes and members have Javadoc as needed or desired.""
- This is a subjective guideline, not a rule. It suggests that Javadoc can be added as needed or desired, but it does not mandate or enforce any specific action.

#### Sentence 2:
""Whenever an implementation comment would be used to define the overall purpose or behavior of a class or member, that comment is written as Javadoc instead (using `/**`).""
- This is a rule and it is mandatory. It specifies that implementation comments defining the purpose or behavior of a class or member must be written as Javadoc.

""Non-required Javadoc is not strictly required to follow the formatting rules of Sections 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.2, though it is of course recommended.""

- **Rule 1**: This rule mandates that if an implementation comment is used to define the overall purpose or behavior of a class or member, it must be written as Javadoc.
- **Rule 2**: This rule states that non-required Javadoc does not have to follow the formatting rules specified in Sections 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.2, but it is recommended to do so.

### Analysis:

1. **Type-use annotations appear immediately before the annotated type.**

### Analysis:
1. **Sentence 1**: ""The rules for annotations on method and constructor declarations are the same as the previous section.""
   - This is a reference to another section and not a standalone rule. It is subjective and not classified as a rule.

2. **Sentence 2**: ""Example: @Deprecated @Override public String getNameIfPresent() { ... }""
   - This is an example and not a rule. It is subjective and not classified as a rule.

3. **Sentence 3**: ""Exception: A single parameterless annotation may instead appear together with the first line of the signature, for example: @Override public int hashCode() { ... }""
   - This is an exception to a rule. It is subjective and not classified as a rule.

**4.8.5.4 Field annotations**
Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block, but in this case, multiple annotations (possibly parameterized) may be listed on the same line; for example:
@Partial @Mock DataLoader loader;

### Analysis:

1. **Identify Rules and Classify:**
   - **Sentence 1:** ""Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block.""
     - This is a rule.
     - Classification: Mandatory (since it specifies a required position for annotations).
   - **Sentence 2:** ""but in this case, multiple annotations (possibly parameterized) may be listed on the same line;""
     - This is a rule.
     - Classification: Optional (since it uses ""may"" indicating that it is allowed but not required).

2. **Parse the Rules Using the Given Grammar:**

#### Rule 1:
- **Sentence:** ""Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block.""
- **Formal Java Terms:**
  - [Annotation]
  - [Field]
  - [DocumentationBlock]

- **Parsed Rule:**
  - **Mandatory:** [Annotation] of [Field] is [after] [DocumentationBlock]

#### Rule 2:
- **Sentence:** ""but in this case, multiple annotations (possibly parameterized) may be listed on the same line;""
- **Formal Java Terms:**
  - [Annotation]
  - [Field]
  - [Line]

- **Parsed Rule:**
  - **Optional:** [Number] of [Annotation] of [Field] >= 1 for [Line]

### Final RuleSet Representation:

NO RULE","Let's analyze the given Google Java Style Guide section and parse it using the provided Grammar.

Google Java Style Guide:
4.8.5.5 Parameter and local variable annotations
There are no specific rules for formatting annotations on parameters or local variables (except, of course, when the annotation is a type-use annotation).

### Step 1: Determine if each sentence is a rule and classify it as mandatory or optional.

1. ""There are no specific rules for formatting annotations on parameters or local variables""
   - This sentence indicates the absence of specific rules, so it is not a rule itself.

2. ""(except, of course, when the annotation is a type-use annotation)""
   - This is an exception to the previous statement, indicating that type-use annotations might have specific rules. However, it does not specify what those rules are.

### Step 2: Parse the rule using the given Grammar.

Since the first sentence indicates the absence of specific rules, it does not contribute to a RuleSet. The second sentence is an exception clause but does not provide a concrete rule to parse.

### Final RuleSet Representation:

Given the analysis, there are no specific rules to parse from this section of the style guide. The only information provided is that there are no specific formatting rules for annotations on parameters or local variables, except for type-use annotations, which are not detailed.

Therefore, the RuleSet for this section would be empty or not applicable.

### Conclusion:

The section 4.8.5.5 of the Google Java Style Guide does not provide any specific rules that can be parsed into the given Grammar. It simply states the absence of rules for formatting annotations on parameters or local variables, with a vague exception for type-use annotations.",no rule,,,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,Yes,"<module name='Checker'>

```","Let's analyze the given Google Java Style Guide section 3.4.2.1 and parse it using the provided Grammar.

### Google Java Style Guide:
**3.4.2.1 Overloads: never split**
- Methods of a class that share the same name appear in a single contiguous group with no other members in between.
- The same applies to multiple constructors (which always have the same name).
- This rule applies even when modifiers such as static or private differ between the methods.

### Analysis:
1. **Methods of a class that share the same name appear in a single contiguous group with no other members in between.**
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it uses the word ""never"" and specifies a strict requirement.

2. **The same applies to multiple constructors (which always have the same name).**
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it extends the previous rule to constructors.

3. **This rule applies even when modifiers such as static or private differ between the methods.**
   - This is a clarification of the previous rules.
   - It is mandatory because it specifies that the rule is not affected by modifiers.

### Final RuleSet Representation:
```plaintext

And
Mandatory: [Constructor] of [Class] with [SameName] have [ContiguousGroup] not have [OtherMembers] in [Between]
And
Mandatory: [Method] of [Class] with [SameName] and [DifferentModifiers] have [ContiguousGroup] not have [OtherMembers] in [Between]

### Explanation:
- **Rule 1:** Methods of a class that share the same name must appear in a single contiguous group with no other members in between.
- **Rule 2:** The same rule applies to constructors that share the same name.
- **Rule 3:** This rule is still applicable even if the methods have different modifiers (e.g., static, private).

### Google Java Style Guide:
**4.8.2.1 One variable per declaration**
- Every variable declaration (field or local) declares only one variable: declarations such as `int a, b;` are not used.
- **Exception:** Multiple variable declarations are acceptable in the header of a `for` loop.

### Analysis:
1. **First Sentence:**
   - **Sentence:** ""Every variable declaration (field or local) declares only one variable: declarations such as `int a, b;` are not used.""
   - **Type:** This is a rule.
   - **Classification:** Mandatory (since it uses ""only"" and ""are not used"" which implies a strict requirement).

2. **Second Sentence:**
   - **Sentence:** ""Exception: Multiple variable declarations are acceptable in the header of a `for` loop.""
   - **Type:** This is an exception to the rule.
   - **Classification:** Exception (provides a specific case where the rule does not apply).

### Parsing the Rule using the Given Grammar:
Let's break down the rule and map it to the formal Java terms and operators.

#### Rule:
- **Main Rule:** Every variable declaration (field or local) declares only one variable.
- **Exception:** Multiple variable declarations are acceptable in the header of a `for` loop.

#### Formal Representation:
1. **Main Rule:**

2. **Parse the rule using the given Grammar:**

### Final RuleSet Representation:
```plaintext
Optional: [ArrayInitializer] have [BlockLikeConstruct]

### Explanation:
- **Optional:** Indicates that the rule is not mandatory.
- **[ArrayInitializer]:** Refers to the array initializer in Java.
- **have [BlockLikeConstruct]:** Specifies that the array initializer can be formatted as a block-like construct.

### Grammar Mapping:
- **RuleSet ::= Rule1 [And|Or|; Rule2]*:** We have a single rule here, so no need for And, Or, or semicolon.
- **Rule ::= {{'Optional'| 'Mandatory'}} [ ['Order' of | 'Number' of] TermList [Operator TermList]* | Rule1 '->' Rule2] [ExceptionRule]:** The rule is optional and involves a single term list with an operator.
- **Operator = 'is'| 'is not' | '>=' | '<=' | '=' | '!=' | 'for' | 'not for' | 'before' | 'not before' | 'after' | 'not after' | 'between' | 'not between' | 'have' | 'not have' | 'Add' | 'Sub' | 'Mult' | MatMult | 'Div' | 'Mod' | 'Pow' | 'LShift' | 'RShift' | 'BitOr' | 'BitXor' | 'BitAnd' | 'FloorDiv':** The operator used here is ""have.""
- **TermList ::= Term [, Term]*:** The term list contains two terms: [ArrayInitializer] and [BlockLikeConstruct].
- **JavaTerm means the formal expression using such format [XXX] ""XXX"" represent a JavaTerm:** [ArrayInitializer] and [BlockLikeConstruct] are formal Java terms.

### Google Java Style Guide:
**4.8.3.2 No C-style array declarations**
The square brackets form a part of the type, not the variable: `String[] args`, not `String args[]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Rule Identification**:
   - The statement ""The square brackets form a part of the type, not the variable"" is a rule.
   - The example ""String[] args, not String args[]"" is an illustration of the rule.

2. **Classification**:
   - This rule is **mandatory** because it specifies a strict requirement on how array declarations should be formatted.

### Parsing the Rule:
- The rule specifies that the square brackets should be part of the type declaration, not the variable declaration.
- In formal Java terms, this means that the array type should be declared as `Type[]` rather than `Type variable[]`.

### Final RuleSet Representation:
```plaintext
Mandatory: [ArrayType] have [SquareBrackets] before [VariableName]

### Explanation:
- **Mandatory**: This rule is compulsory.
- **[ArrayType]**: Refers to the type of the array, e.g., `String[]`.
- **have**: Indicates possession or inclusion.
- **[SquareBrackets]**: Refers to the `[]` notation.
- **before**: Specifies the order.
- **[VariableName]**: Refers to the name of the variable, e.g., `args`.

### Google Java Style Guide:
**4.8.4 Switch statements**
Terminology Note: Inside the braces of a switch block are one or more statement groups. Each statement group consists of one or more switch labels (either `case FOO:` or `default:`), followed by one or more statements (or, for the last statement group, zero or more statements).

### Analysis:

1. **Terminology Note**: This section is primarily descriptive and does not contain explicit rules. It defines the structure of a switch block and its components.

2. **Identifying Rules**:
   - The description does not explicitly state any rules that are mandatory or optional.
   - It provides a structural definition of a switch block, which is more informative than prescriptive.

### Parsing the Description:

Since the provided text is descriptive and does not contain explicit rules, we will not classify it as mandatory or optional. However, we can still map the description to a formal representation using the given Grammar to make its semantics clear.

### Formal Representation:

#### Terminology Note:
- **Switch Block**: Contains one or more statement groups.
- **Statement Group**: Consists of one or more switch labels followed by one or more statements.
- **Switch Labels**: Can be either `case FOO:` or `default:`.
- **Statements**: Can be zero or more for the last statement group.

### RuleSet Representation:

Since there are no explicit rules, we will represent the structure descriptively:

```plaintext
Descriptive: [SwitchBlock] have [StatementGroup]
Descriptive: [StatementGroup] have [SwitchLabel], [Statement]
Descriptive: [SwitchLabel] is [CaseLabel] or [DefaultLabel]
Descriptive: [Number] of [Statement] >= 0 for [last] [StatementGroup]
Descriptive: [Number] of [Statement] >= 1 for [other] [StatementGroup]
```

### Explanation:

- **SwitchBlock**: Contains one or more **StatementGroup**.
- **StatementGroup**: Contains one or more **SwitchLabel** and one or more **Statement**.
- **SwitchLabel**: Can be either **CaseLabel** (`case FOO:`) or **DefaultLabel** (`default:`).
- **Number of Statements**: For the last **StatementGroup**, the number of **Statements** can be zero or more. For other **StatementGroups**, the number of **Statements** must be one or more.

### Conclusion:

The provided section 4.8.4 of the Google Java Style Guide is descriptive and does not contain explicit rules that can be classified as mandatory or optional. The formal representation captures the structure of a switch block and its components as described in the text.","Terminology Note

The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.
Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks. For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those lines after the first. Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line, its indentation will not take effect. All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.","arrayInitIndent

**4.8.4.2 Fall-through: commented**
Within a switch block, each statement group either terminates abruptly (with a break, continue, return or thrown exception), or is marked with a comment to indicate that execution will or might continue into the next statement group. Any comment that communicates the idea of fall-through is sufficient (typically // fall through). This special comment is not required in the last statement group of the switch block. Example:
```java
switch (input) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
    prepareOneOrTwo();
    // fall through
  case 3:

    break;

     - **Classification:** Mandatory
   - **Rule 2:** ""Any comment that communicates the idea of fall-through is sufficient (typically // fall through).""

   - **Rule 4:** ""Notice that no comment is needed after case 1:, only at the end of the statement group.""

  -> [SwitchStatement] of [EnumType] have [ExplicitCases] covering [AllPossibleValues]
```

This representation captures the main rule that every `SwitchStatement` must have a `DefaultStatementGroup`, and the exception that allows `SwitchStatement` of `EnumType` to omit the `DefaultStatementGroup` if it has `ExplicitCases` covering all possible values.","Let's analyze the provided Google Java Style Guide section 4.8.4.3 and parse it using the given Grammar.

### Google Java Style Guide:
**4.8.4.3 Presence of the default label**
- Each switch statement includes a default statement group, even if it contains no code.
- Exception: A switch statement for an enum type may omit the default statement group, if it includes explicit cases covering all possible values of that type. This enables IDEs or other static analysis tools to issue a warning if any cases were missed.

### Analysis:

1. **Each switch statement includes a default statement group, even if it contains no code.**
   - This is a rule.
   - It is mandatory because it uses the word ""includes"" which implies a requirement.

2. **Exception: A switch statement for an enum type may omit the default statement group, if it includes explicit cases covering all possible values of that type.**
   - This is an exception to the rule.
   - It specifies a condition under which the mandatory rule does not apply.

### Parsing the Rule using the Given Grammar:

#### Rule 1:
- **Mandatory**: [SwitchStatement] have [DefaultStatementGroup]

#### Exception Rule:
- **Except**: [SwitchStatement] of [EnumType] have [DefaultStatementGroup]
  - **If**: [SwitchStatement] of [EnumType] have [ExplicitCases] covering [AllPossibleValues]

### Final RuleSet Representation:

```plaintext
Mandatory: [SwitchStatement] have [DefaultStatementGroup]
Except: [SwitchStatement] of [EnumType] have [DefaultStatementGroup]
  -> [SwitchStatement] of [EnumType] have [ExplicitCases] covering [AllPossibleValues]
```

### Explanation:
- The main rule is that every `SwitchStatement` must have a `DefaultStatementGroup`.
- The exception to this rule is for `SwitchStatement` of `EnumType`. If the `SwitchStatement` of `EnumType` has `ExplicitCases` covering all possible values, then it can omit the `DefaultStatementGroup`.

### Google Java Style Guide:
#### 4.8.6 Block comment style
1. Block comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code.
2. They may be in `/* ... */` style or `// ...` style.
3. For multi-line `/* ... */` comments, subsequent lines must start with `*` aligned with the `*` on the previous line.
4. Comments are not enclosed in boxes drawn with asterisks or other characters.
5. Tip: When writing multi-line comments, use the `/* ... */` style if you want automatic code formatters to re-wrap the lines when necessary (paragraph-style). Most formatters don't re-wrap lines in `// ...` style comment blocks.

### Analysis and Classification:
1. **Rule**: Block comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code.
   - **Classification**: Mandatory
2. **Rule**: They may be in `/* ... */` style or `// ...` style.
   - **Classification**: Optional
3. **Rule**: For multi-line `/* ... */` comments, subsequent lines must start with `*` aligned with the `*` on the previous line.
   - **Classification**: Mandatory
4. **Rule**: Comments are not enclosed in boxes drawn with asterisks or other characters.
   - **Classification**: Mandatory
5. **Tip**: When writing multi-line comments, use the `/* ... */` style if you want automatic code formatters to re-wrap the lines when necessary (paragraph-style). Most formatters don't re-wrap lines in `// ...` style comment blocks.
