Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
7.1.1 General form
The basic formatting of Javadoc blocks is as seen in this example:
 /**
  * Multiple lines of Javadoc text are written here,
  * wrapped normally...
  */
 public int method(String p1) { ... }
 

 ... or in this single-line example:
 /** An especially short bit of Javadoc. */
 

 The basic form is always acceptable. The single-line form may be substituted when the entirety of the Javadoc block (including comment markers) can fit on a single line. Note that this only applies when there are no block tags such as `@return` .

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
SingleLineJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that a Javadoc block can fit in a single-line and doesn't
contain block tags. Javadoc comment that contains at least one block tag
should be formatted in a few lines.
[Options]
ignoreInlineTags, Control whether
inline tags must be ignored.
ignoredTags, Specify
block tags which are ignored by the check.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocParagraph
[Description]
Checks the Javadoc paragraph.


Checks that:



There is one blank line between each of two paragraphs.


Each paragraph but the first has <p> immediately before the first word, with
no space after.
[Options]
allowNewlineParagraph, Control whether the <p> tag should be placed immediately before the first word.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocContentLocation
[Description]
Checks that the Javadoc content begins from the same position
for all Javadoc comments in the project. Any leading asterisks and spaces
are not counted as the beginning of the content and are therefore ignored.


It is possible to enforce two different styles:



{@code first_line} - Javadoc content starts from the first line:



/** Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();



{@code second_line} - Javadoc content starts from the second line:



/**
* Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();
[Options]
location, Specify the policy on placement of the Javadoc content.
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Options]
arrayInitIndent, Specify how far an array initialization should be indented when on next line.
basicOffset, Specify how far new indentation level should be indented when on the next line.
braceAdjustment, Specify how far a braces should be indented when on the next line.
caseIndent, Specify how far a case label should be indented when on next line.
forceStrictCondition, Force strict indent level in line wrapping case. If value is true, line wrap indent have to be same as lineWrappingIndentation parameter. If value is false, line wrap indent could be bigger on any value user would like.
lineWrappingIndentation, Specify how far continuation line should be indented when line-wrapping is present.
throwsIndent, Specify how far a throws clause should be indented when on next line.
[Rule]
RequireEmptyLineBeforeBlockTagGroup
[Description]
Checks that one blank line before the block tag if it is present in Javadoc.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
InvalidJavadocPosition
[Description]
Checks that Javadocs are located at the correct position.
As specified at

Documentation Comment Specification for the Standard Doclet,
Javadocs are recognized only when placed immediately before module, package, class,
interface, constructor, method, or field declarations. Any other position, like
in the body of a method, will be ignored by the javadoc tool and is considered
invalid by this check.
[Options]
[Rule]
JavadocBlockTagLocation
[Description]
Checks that a

javadoc block tag appears only at the beginning of a line, ignoring
leading asterisks and white space. A block tag is a token that starts
with @ symbol and is preceded by a whitespace. This check
ignores block tags in comments and inside inline tags {@code } and
{@literal }.


Rationale: according to

the specification all javadoc block tags should be placed at the
beginning of a line. Tags that are not placed at the beginning are treated
as plain text. To recognize intentional tag placement to text area
it is better to escape the @ symbol, and all non-escaped
tags should be located at the beginning of the line. See NOTE section
for details on how to escape.
[Options]
tags, Specify the javadoc tags to process.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingLeadingAsterisk
[Description]
Checks if the javadoc has

leading asterisks

on each line.


The check does not require asterisks on the first line, nor on the last line
if it is blank. All other lines in a Javadoc should start with *,
including blank lines and code blocks.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Options]
offset, Specify how many spaces to use for new indentation level.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
WriteTag
[Description]
Requires user defined Javadoc tag to be present in Javadoc comment with
defined format. To define the format for a tag, set property tagFormat to a regular
expression. Property tagSeverity is used for severity of events when the tag exists.
[Options]
tag, Specify the name of tag.
tagFormat, Specify the regexp to match tag content.
tagSeverity, Specify the severity level when tag is found and printed.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
