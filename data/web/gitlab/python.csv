macOS,Installation/macOS,"To install `pyenv` on macOS, you can use Homebrew with:","brew install pyenv
",
Windows,Installation/Windows,"`pyenv` does not officially support Windows and does not work in Windows outside the Windows Subsystem for Linux. If you are a Windows user, you can use `pyenv-win` .
To install `pyenv-win` on Windows, run the following PowerShell command:","Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1"" -OutFile ""./install-pyenv-win.ps1""; &""./install-pyenv-win.ps1""

Dependency management,Dependency management,"While GitLab doesn’t directly contain any Python scripts, because we depend on Python to render reStructuredText markup, we need to keep track on dependencies on the main project level, so we can run that on our development machines.
Recently, an equivalent to the `Gemfile` and the Bundler project has been introduced to Python: `Pipfile` and Pipenv .
A `Pipfile` with the dependencies now exists in the root folder. To install them, run:","pipenv install
",Running this command installs both the required Python version as well as required pip dependencies.
Use instructions,Use instructions,"To run any Python code under the Pipenv environment, you need to first start a `virtualenv` based on the dependencies of the application. With Pipenv, this is a simple as running:","pipenv shell
","After running that command, you can run GitLab on the same shell and it uses the Python and dependencies installed from the `pipenvinstall` command."
