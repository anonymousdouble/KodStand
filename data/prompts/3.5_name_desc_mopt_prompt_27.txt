Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.8.1 Enum classes
After each comma that follows an enum constant, a line break is optional. Additional blank lines (usually just one) are also allowed. This is one possibility:
 private enum Answer {
  YES {
  @Override public String toString() {
  return "yes";
  }
  },
 

  NO,
  MAYBE
 }
 

 An enum class with no methods and no documentation on its constants may optionally be formatted as if it were an array initializer (see Section 4.8.3.1 on array initializers ).
 private enum Suit { CLUBS, HEARTS, SPADES, DIAMONDS }
 

 Since enum classes are classes , all other rules for formatting classes apply.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
NoEnumTrailingComma
[Description]
Checks that enum definition does not contain a trailing comma.
Rationale: JLS allows trailing commas in arrays and enumerations, but does not allow
them in other locations. To unify the coding style, the use of trailing commas should
be prohibited.



enum Foo1 {
FOO,
BAR;
}


The check demands that there should not be any comma after last constant in
enum definition.



enum Foo1 {
FOO,
BAR, //violation
}
[Options]
[Rule]
MultipleVariableDeclarations
[Description]
Checks that each variable declaration is in its own statement and on
its own line.


Rationale:

the Java code conventions chapter 6.1 recommends that
declarations should be one per line/statement.
[Options]
[Rule]
DeclarationOrder
[Description]
Checks that the parts of a class, record, or interface declaration appear in the order
suggested by the

Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language.


According to

Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language , the parts
of a class or interface declaration should appear in the following
order:



Class (static) variables. First the public class variables, then
protected, then package level (no access modifier), and then
private.


Instance variables. First the public class variables, then
protected, then package level (no access modifier), and then
private.

Constructors
Methods


Purpose of ignore* option is to ignore related violations,
however it still impacts on other class members.


ATTENTION: the check skips class fields which have

forward references
from validation due to the fact that we have Checkstyle's limitations to clearly
detect user intention of fields location and grouping. For example:



public class A {
private double x = 1.0;
private double y = 2.0;
public double slope = x / y; // will be skipped from validation due to forward reference
}
[Options]
ignoreConstructors, Control whether to ignore constructors.
ignoreModifiers, Control whether to ignore modifiers (fields, ...).
[Rule]
ModifierOrder
[Description]
Checks that the order of modifiers conforms to the suggestions in
the Java
Language specification, ¡ì 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3 and

9.4. The correct order is:



public


protected


private


abstract


default


static


sealed


non-sealed


final


transient


volatile


synchronized


native


strictfp



In additional, modifiers are checked to ensure all annotations are
declared before all other modifiers.


Rationale: Code is easier to read if everybody follows a standard.


ATTENTION: We skip

type annotations from validation.
[Options]
[Rule]
SingleSpaceSeparator
[Description]
Checks that non-whitespace characters are separated by no more than one
whitespace. Separating characters by tabs or multiple spaces will be
reported. Currently, the check doesn't permit horizontal alignment. To inspect
whitespaces before and after comments, set the property
validateComments to true.


Setting validateComments to false will ignore cases like:



int i;  // Multiple whitespaces before comment tokens will be ignored.
private void foo(int  /* whitespaces before and after block-comments will be
ignored */  i) {


Sometimes, users like to space similar items on different lines to the same
column position for easier reading. This feature isn't supported by this
check, so both braces in the following case will be reported as violations.



public long toNanos(long d)  { return d;             } // 2 violations
public long toMicros(long d) { return d / (C1 / C0); }
[Options]
validateComments, Control whether to validate whitespaces surrounding comments.
[Rule]
UnnecessarySemicolonInEnumeration
[Description]
Checks if unnecessary semicolon is in enum definitions.
Semicolon is not needed if enum body contains only enum constants.
[Options]
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Options]
arrayInitIndent, Specify how far an array initialization should be indented when on next line.
basicOffset, Specify how far new indentation level should be indented when on the next line.
braceAdjustment, Specify how far a braces should be indented when on the next line.
caseIndent, Specify how far a case label should be indented when on next line.
forceStrictCondition, Force strict indent level in line wrapping case. If value is true, line wrap indent have to be same as lineWrappingIndentation parameter. If value is false, line wrap indent could be bigger on any value user would like.
lineWrappingIndentation, Specify how far continuation line should be indented when line-wrapping is present.
throwsIndent, Specify how far a throws clause should be indented when on next line.
[Rule]
ConstantName
[Description]
Checks that constant names conform to a specified pattern.
A constant is a static and final field or an
interface/annotation field, except serialVersionUID and
serialPersistentFields.
[Options]
applyToPackage, Control if check should apply to package-private members.
applyToPrivate, Control if check should apply to private members.
applyToProtected, Control if check should apply to protected members.
applyToPublic, Control if check should apply to public members.
format, Sets the pattern to match valid identifiers.
[Rule]
OneTopLevelClass
[Description]
Checks that each top-level class, interface, enum
or annotation resides in a source file of its own.
Official description of a 'top-level' term:
7.6. Top Level Type Declarations.
If file doesn't contain public class, interface, enum or annotation,
top-level type is the first type in file.
[Options]
[Rule]
HideUtilityClassConstructor
[Description]
Makes sure that utility classes (classes that contain only static
methods or fields in their API) do not have a public constructor.


Rationale: Instantiating utility classes does not make sense. Hence,
the constructors should either be private or (if you want to allow
subclassing) protected. A common mistake is forgetting to hide the
default constructor.


If you make the constructor protected you may want to consider the
following constructor implementation technique to disallow
instantiating subclasses:



public class StringUtils // not final to allow subclassing
{
protected StringUtils() {
// prevents calls from subclass
throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

public static int count(char c, String s) {
// ...
}
}
[Options]

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
