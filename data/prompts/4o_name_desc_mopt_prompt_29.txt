Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.8.6 Comments
This section addresses implementation comments . Javadoc is addressed separately in Section 7, Javadoc .
 Any line break may be preceded by arbitrary whitespace followed by an implementation comment. Such a comment renders the line non-blank.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
JavadocParagraph
[Description]
Checks the Javadoc paragraph.


Checks that:



There is one blank line between each of two paragraphs.


Each paragraph but the first has <p> immediately before the first word, with
no space after.
[Options]
allowNewlineParagraph, Control whether the <p> tag should be placed immediately before the first word.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingWhitespaceAfterAsterisk
[Description]
Checks that there is at least one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
Although spaces after asterisks are optional in the Javadoc comments, their absence
makes the documentation difficult to read. It is the de facto standard to put at least
one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
SingleSpaceSeparator
[Description]
Checks that non-whitespace characters are separated by no more than one
whitespace. Separating characters by tabs or multiple spaces will be
reported. Currently, the check doesn't permit horizontal alignment. To inspect
whitespaces before and after comments, set the property
validateComments to true.


Setting validateComments to false will ignore cases like:



int i;  // Multiple whitespaces before comment tokens will be ignored.
private void foo(int  /* whitespaces before and after block-comments will be
ignored */  i) {


Sometimes, users like to space similar items on different lines to the same
column position for easier reading. This feature isn't supported by this
check, so both braces in the following case will be reported as violations.



public long toNanos(long d)  { return d;             } // 2 violations
public long toMicros(long d) { return d / (C1 / C0); }
[Options]
validateComments, Control whether to validate whitespaces surrounding comments.
[Rule]
RequireEmptyLineBeforeBlockTagGroup
[Description]
Checks that one blank line before the block tag if it is present in Javadoc.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
SingleLineJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that a Javadoc block can fit in a single-line and doesn't
contain block tags. Javadoc comment that contains at least one block tag
should be formatted in a few lines.
[Options]
ignoreInlineTags, Control whether
inline tags must be ignored.
ignoredTags, Specify
block tags which are ignored by the check.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingLeadingAsterisk
[Description]
Checks if the javadoc has

leading asterisks

on each line.


The check does not require asterisks on the first line, nor on the last line
if it is blank. All other lines in a Javadoc should start with *,
including blank lines and code blocks.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Options]
offset, Specify how many spaces to use for new indentation level.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
TrailingComment
[Description]
The check to ensure that lines with code do not end with comment.
For the case of // comments that means that the only thing
that should precede it is whitespace. It doesn't check comments if
they do not end a line; for example, it accepts the following:
Thread.sleep( 10 /*some comment here*/ ); Format
property is intended to deal with the } // while example.


Rationale: Steve McConnell in Code Complete suggests that
endline comments are a bad practice. An end line comment would be
one that is on the same line as actual code. For example:



a = b + c;      // Some insightful comment
d = e / f;        // Another comment for this line


Quoting Code Complete for the justification:


"The comments have to be aligned so that they do not
interfere with the visual structure of the code. If you don't align
them neatly, they'll make your listing look like it's been through a
washing machine."

"Endline comments tend to be hard to format...It takes
time to align them. Such time is not spent learning more about the
code; it's dedicated solely to the tedious task of pressing the
spacebar or tab key."

"Endline comments are also hard to maintain. If the code
on any line containing an endline comment grows, it bumps the
comment farther out, and all the other endline comments will have to
bumped out to match. Styles that are hard to maintain aren't
maintained...."

"Endline comments also tend to be cryptic. The right side
of the line doesn't offer much room and the desire to keep the
comment on one line means the comment must be short. Work then goes
into making the line as short as possible instead of as clear as
possible. The comment usually ends up as cryptic as
possible...."

"A systemic problem with endline comments is that it's
hard to write a meaningful comment for one line of code. Most
endline comments just repeat the line of code, which hurts more than
it helps."



McConnell's comments on being hard to maintain when the size of the line
changes are even more important in the age of automated
refactorings.
[Options]
format, Specify pattern for strings allowed before the comment.
legalComment, Define pattern for text allowed in trailing comments. This pattern will not be applied to multiline comments.
[Rule]
JavadocContentLocation
[Description]
Checks that the Javadoc content begins from the same position
for all Javadoc comments in the project. Any leading asterisks and spaces
are not counted as the beginning of the content and are therefore ignored.


It is possible to enforce two different styles:



{@code first_line} - Javadoc content starts from the first line:



/** Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();



{@code second_line} - Javadoc content starts from the second line:



/**
* Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();
[Options]
location, Specify the policy on placement of the Javadoc content.
[Rule]
JavadocBlockTagLocation
[Description]
Checks that a

javadoc block tag appears only at the beginning of a line, ignoring
leading asterisks and white space. A block tag is a token that starts
with @ symbol and is preceded by a whitespace. This check
ignores block tags in comments and inside inline tags {@code } and
{@literal }.


Rationale: according to

the specification all javadoc block tags should be placed at the
beginning of a line. Tags that are not placed at the beginning are treated
as plain text. To recognize intentional tag placement to text area
it is better to escape the @ symbol, and all non-escaped
tags should be located at the beginning of the line. See NOTE section
for details on how to escape.
[Options]
tags, Specify the javadoc tags to process.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
