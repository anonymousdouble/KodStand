# no-loss-of-precision
## Overview
Disallow literal numbers that lose precision


âœ… Recommended

            The `"extends": "eslint:recommended"` property in a configuration file  enables this rule
        


This rule would disallow the use of number literals that lose precision at runtime when converted to a JS `Number` due to 64-bit floating-point rounding.
## Rule Details
In JS, `Number`s are stored as double-precision floating-point numbers according to the IEEE 754 standard . Because of this, numbers can only retain accuracy up to a certain amount of digits. If the programmer enters additional digits, those digits will be lost in the conversion to the `Number` type and will result in unexpected behavior.
Examples of incorrect code for this rule:


```json
/*eslint no-loss-of-precision: "error"*/

const a = 9007199254740993
const b = 5123000000000000000000000000001
const c = 1230000000000000000000000.0
const d = .1230000000000000000000000
const e = 0X20000000000001
const f = 0X2_000000000_0001;
```
Examples of correct code for this rule:


```json
/*eslint no-loss-of-precision: "error"*/

const a = 12345
const b = 123.456
const c = 123e34
const d = 12300000000000000000000000
const e = 0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFF
const f = 9007199254740991
const g = 9007_1992547409_91
```

## Version
This rule was introduced in ESLint v7.1.0.
