Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.2 Block indentation: +2 spaces
Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by two spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block. (See the example in Section 4.1.2, Nonempty blocks: K & R Style .)

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Options]
arrayInitIndent, Specify how far an array initialization should be indented when on next line.
basicOffset, Specify how far new indentation level should be indented when on the next line.
braceAdjustment, Specify how far a braces should be indented when on the next line.
caseIndent, Specify how far a case label should be indented when on next line.
forceStrictCondition, Force strict indent level in line wrapping case. If value is true, line wrap indent have to be same as lineWrappingIndentation parameter. If value is false, line wrap indent could be bigger on any value user would like.
lineWrappingIndentation, Specify how far continuation line should be indented when line-wrapping is present.
throwsIndent, Specify how far a throws clause should be indented when on next line.
[Rule]
CommentsIndentation
[Description]
Controls the indentation between comments and surrounding code.
Comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code.
Detailed info about such convention can be found

[Options]
tokens, tokens to check
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Options]
offset, Specify how many spaces to use for new indentation level.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
AvoidNestedBlocks
[Description]
Finds nested blocks (blocks that are used freely in the code).


Rationale: Nested blocks are often leftovers from the
debugging process, they confuse the reader.


For example, this check finds the obsolete braces in



public void guessTheOutput()
{
int whichIsWhich = 0;
{
whichIsWhich = 2;
}
System.out.println("value = " + whichIsWhich);
}

and debugging / refactoring leftovers such as


// if (conditionThatIsNotUsedAnyLonger)
{
System.out.println("unconditional");
}


A case in a switch statement does not implicitly form a block.
Thus, to be able to introduce local variables that have case
scope it is necessary to open a nested block. This is
supported, set the allowInSwitchCase property to true and
include all statements of the case in the block.
[Options]
allowInSwitchCase, Allow nested blocks if they are the only child of a switch case.
[Rule]
RequireEmptyLineBeforeBlockTagGroup
[Description]
Checks that one blank line before the block tag if it is present in Javadoc.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
SingleSpaceSeparator
[Description]
Checks that non-whitespace characters are separated by no more than one
whitespace. Separating characters by tabs or multiple spaces will be
reported. Currently, the check doesn't permit horizontal alignment. To inspect
whitespaces before and after comments, set the property
validateComments to true.


Setting validateComments to false will ignore cases like:



int i;  // Multiple whitespaces before comment tokens will be ignored.
private void foo(int  /* whitespaces before and after block-comments will be
ignored */  i) {


Sometimes, users like to space similar items on different lines to the same
column position for easier reading. This feature isn't supported by this
check, so both braces in the following case will be reported as violations.



public long toNanos(long d)  { return d;             } // 2 violations
public long toMicros(long d) { return d / (C1 / C0); }
[Options]
validateComments, Control whether to validate whitespaces surrounding comments.
[Rule]
SingleLineJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that a Javadoc block can fit in a single-line and doesn't
contain block tags. Javadoc comment that contains at least one block tag
should be formatted in a few lines.
[Options]
ignoreInlineTags, Control whether
inline tags must be ignored.
ignoredTags, Specify
block tags which are ignored by the check.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
NeedBraces
[Description]
Checks for braces around code blocks.
[Options]
allowEmptyLoopBody, Allow loops with empty bodies.
allowSingleLineStatement, Allow single-line statements without braces.
tokens, tokens to check
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Options]
treatTryResourcesAsStatement, Enable resources processing.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingWhitespaceAfterAsterisk
[Description]
Checks that there is at least one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
Although spaces after asterisks are optional in the Javadoc comments, their absence
makes the documentation difficult to read. It is the de facto standard to put at least
one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
[Options]
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
