Ensures that a class has a package declaration, and (optionally) whether
the package name matches the directory name for the source file.


Rationale: Classes that live in the null package cannot be
imported. Many novice developers are not aware of this.


Packages provide logical namespace to classes and should be stored in
the form of directory levels to provide physical grouping to your classes.
These directories are added to the classpath so that your classes
are visible to JVM when it runs the code.","Properties
