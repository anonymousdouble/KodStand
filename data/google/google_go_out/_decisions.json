A variable created at file scope may require multiple\nwords, whereas a variable scoped to a single inner block may be a single word or\neven just a character or two, to keep the code clear and avoid extraneous\ninformation.\n   \n    Here is a rough baseline. These numeric guidelines are not strict rules. Apply\njudgement based on context,\n    \n     clarity\n    \n    , and\n    \n     concision\n    \n    .\n   \n\n     A small scope is one in which one or two small operations are performed, say\n1-7 lines.\n    \n\n     A medium scope is a few small or one large operation, say 8-15 lines.\n    \n\n     A large scope is one or a few large operations, say 15-25 lines.\n    \n\n     A very large scope is anything that spans more than a page (say, more than\n25 lines).\n    \n\n    A name that might be perfectly clear (e.g.,\n    \n     c\n    \n    for a counter) within a small\nscope could be insufficient in a larger scope and would require clarification to\nremind the reader of its purpose further along in the code. A scope in which\nthere are many variables, or variables that represent similar values or\nconcepts, may necessitate longer variable names than the scope suggests.\n   \n    The specificity of the concept can also help to keep a variable’s name concise.\nFor example, assuming there is only a single database in use, a short variable\nname like\n    \n     db\n    \n    that might normally be reserved for very small scopes may remain\nperfectly clear even if the scope is very large. In this case, a single word\n    \n     database\n    \n    is likely acceptable based on the size of the scope, but is not\nrequired as\n    \n     db\n    \n    is a very common shortening for the word with few alternate\ninterpretations.\n   \n    The name of a local variable should reflect what it contains and how it is being\nused in the current context, rather than where the value originated. For\nexample, it is often the case that the best local variable name is not the same\nas the struct or protocol buffer field name.\n   \n    In general:\n   \n\n     Single-word names like\n     \n      count\n     \n     or\n     \n      options\n     \n     are a good starting point.\n    \n\n     Additional words can be added to disambiguate similar names, for example\n     \n      userCount\n     \n     and\n     \n      projectCount\n     \n     .\n    \n\n     Do not simply drop letters to save typing.

In general, they should only be called\nearly on program startup, not on things like user input where normal Go error\nhandling is preferred.\n   \n    This often comes up for functions called to initialize package-level variables\nexclusively at\n    \n     package initialization time\n    \n    (e.g.\n    \n     template.Must\n    \n    and\n    \n     regexp.MustCompile\n    \n    ).\n   \n\n// Good:\nfunc MustParse(version string) *Version {\n    v, err := Parse(version)\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(fmt.Sprintf(\"MustParse(%q) = _, %v\", version, err))\n    }\n    return v\n}\n\n// Package level \"constant\". If we wanted to use `Parse`, we would have had to\n// set the value in `init`.\nvar DefaultVersion = MustParse(\"1.2.3\")\n\n\n\n    The same convention may be used in test helpers that only stop the current test\n(using\n    \n     t.Fatal\n    \n    ). Such helpers are often convenient in creating test values,\nfor example in struct fields of\n    \n     table driven tests\n    \n    , as\nfunctions that return errors cannot be directly assigned to a struct field.\n   \n\n// Good:\nfunc mustMarshalAny(t *testing.T, m proto.Message) *anypb.Any {\n  t.Helper()\n  any, err := anypb.New(m)\n  if err != nil {\n    t.Fatalf(\"mustMarshalAny(t, m) = %v; want %v\", err, nil)\n  }\n  return any\n}\n\nfunc TestCreateObject(t *testing.T) {\n  tests := []struct{\n    desc string\n    data *anypb.Any\n  }{\n    {\n      desc: \"my test case\",\n      // Creating values directly within table driven test cases.\n      data: mustMarshalAny(t, mypb.Object{}),\n    },\n    // ...\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\n\n\n    In both of these cases, the value of this pattern is that the helpers can be\ncalled in a “value” context. These helpers should not be called in places where\nit’s difficult to ensure an error would be caught or in a context where an error\nshould be\n    \n     checked\n    \n    (e.g., in many request handlers). For\nconstant inputs, this allows tests to easily ensure that the\n    \n     Must\n    \n    arguments\nare well-formed, and for non-constant inputs it permits tests to validate that\nerrors are\n    \n     properly handled or propagated\n    \n    .\n   \n    Where\n    \n     Must\n    \n    functions are used in a test, they should generally be\n    \n     marked as a test helper\n    \n    and call\n    \n     t.Fatal\n    \n    on error (see\n    \n     error handling in test helpers\n    \n    for\nmore considerations of using that).\n   \n    They should not be used when\n    \n     ordinary error handling\n    \n    is possible (including\nwith some refactoring):\n   \n\n// Bad:\nfunc Version(o *servicepb.Object) (*version.Version, error) {\n    // Return error instead of using Must functions.\n    v := version.MustParse(o.GetVersionString())\n    return dealiasVersion(v)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Always prefer\ntaking a context from your caller, unless it’s the wrong context.\n    \n\n     You may come across server libraries (the implementation of Stubby, gRPC, or\nHTTP in Google’s server framework for Go) that construct a fresh context\nobject per request. These contexts are immediately filled with information\nfrom the incoming request, so that when passed to the request handler, the\ncontext’s attached values have been propagated to it across the network\nboundary from the client caller. Moreover, these contexts’ lifetimes are\nscoped to that of the request: when the request is finished, the context is\ncancelled.\n    \n\n     Unless you are implementing a server framework, you shouldn’t create contexts\nwith\n     \n      context.Background()\n     \n     in library code. Instead, prefer using context\ndetachment, which is mentioned below, if there is an existing context\navailable. If you think you do need\n     \n      context.Background()\n     \n     outside of\nentrypoint functions, discuss it with the Google Go style mailing list before\ncommitting to an implementation.\n    \n\n    The convention that\n    \n     context.Context\n    \n    comes first in functions also applies to\ntest helpers.\n   \n\n// Good:\nfunc readTestFile(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, path string) string {}\n\n\n\n    Do not add a context member to a struct type. Instead, add a context parameter\nto each method on the type that needs to pass it along. The one exception is for\nmethods whose signature must match an interface in the standard library or in a\nthird party library outside Google’s control. Such cases are very rare, and\nshould be discussed with the Google Go style mailing list before implementation\nand readability review.\n   \n    Code in the Google codebase that must spawn background operations which can run\nafter the parent context has been cancelled can use an internal package for\ndetachment.

If needed, you may use\ndifferent names or add extra facilities such as subtests or setup and cleanup\nfunctions.

There’s no need to\n    \n     identify the row numerically\n    \n    .\n   \n    When some test cases need to be checked using different logic from other test\ncases, it is more appropriate to write multiple test functions, as explained in\n    \n     GoTip #50: Disjoint Table Tests\n    \n    . The logic of your test code can get difficult\nto understand when each entry in a table has its own different conditional logic\nto check each output for its inputs. If test cases have different logic but\nidentical setup, a sequence of\n    \n     subtests\n    \n    within a single test\nfunction might make sense.\n   \n    You can combine table-driven tests with multiple test functions. For example,\nwhen testing that a function’s output exactly matches the expected output and\nthat the function returns a non-nil error for an invalid input, then writing two\nseparate table-driven test functions is the best approach: one for normal\nnon-error outputs, and one for error outputs.\n   \n\n\n",
