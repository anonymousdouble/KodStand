Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
2.3.3 Non-ASCII characters
For the remaining non-ASCII characters, either the actual Unicode character (e.g. `¡Þ` ) or the equivalent Unicode escape (e.g. `\u221e` ) is used. The choice depends only on which makes the code easier to read and understand , although Unicode escapes outside string literals and comments are strongly discouraged.
 Tip: In the Unicode escape case, and occasionally even when actual Unicode characters are used, an explanatory comment can be very helpful.
 Examples:
 Example 
 Discussion 
 `StringunitAbbrev="¦Ìs";` 
 Best: perfectly clear even without a comment. 
 `StringunitAbbrev="\u03bcs";//"¦Ìs"` 
 Allowed, but there's no reason to do this. 
 `StringunitAbbrev="\u03bcs";//Greeklettermu,"s"` 
 Allowed, but awkward and prone to mistakes. 
 `StringunitAbbrev="\u03bcs";` 
 Poor: the reader has no idea what this is. 
 `return'\ufeff'+content;//byteordermark` 
 Good: use escapes for non-printable characters, and comment if necessary.
 Tip: Never make your code less readable simply out of fear that some programs might not handle non-ASCII characters properly. If that should happen, those programs are broken and they must be fixed .

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
AvoidEscapedUnicodeCharacters
[Description]
Restricts using

Unicode escapes (such as \u221e).
It is possible to allow using escapes for

non-printable, control characters.
Also, this check can be configured to allow using escapes
if trail comment is present. By the option it is possible to
allow using escapes if literal contains only them.
[Options]
allowByTailComment, Allow use escapes if trail comment is present.
allowEscapesForControlCharacters, Allow use escapes for non-printable, control characters.
allowIfAllCharactersEscaped, Allow if all characters in literal are escaped.
allowNonPrintableEscapes, Allow use escapes for non-printable, whitespace characters.
[Rule]
AbbreviationAsWordInName
[Description]
Validates abbreviations (consecutive capital letters) length in identifier name,
it also allows to enforce camel case naming. Please read more at

Google Style Guide
to get to know how to avoid long abbreviations in names.

'_' is considered as word separator in identifier name.

allowedAbbreviationLength specifies how many consecutive capital letters are
allowed in the identifier.
A value of 3 indicates that up to 4 consecutive capital letters are allowed,
one after the other, before a violation is printed. The identifier 'MyTEST' would be
allowed, but 'MyTESTS' would not be.
A value of 0 indicates that only 1 consecutive capital letter is allowed. This
is what should be used to enforce strict camel casing. The identifier 'MyTest' would
be allowed, but 'MyTEst' would not be.


ignoreFinal, ignoreStatic, and ignoreStaticFinal
control whether variables with the respective modifiers are to be ignored.
Note that a variable that is both static and final will always be considered under
ignoreStaticFinal only, regardless of the values of ignoreFinal
and ignoreStatic. So for example if ignoreStatic is true but
ignoreStaticFinal is false, then static final variables will not be ignored.
[Rule]
SingleSpaceSeparator
[Description]
Checks that non-whitespace characters are separated by no more than one
whitespace. Separating characters by tabs or multiple spaces will be
reported. Currently, the check doesn't permit horizontal alignment. To inspect
whitespaces before and after comments, set the property
validateComments to true.


Setting validateComments to false will ignore cases like:



int i;  // Multiple whitespaces before comment tokens will be ignored.
private void foo(int  /* whitespaces before and after block-comments will be
ignored */  i) {


Sometimes, users like to space similar items on different lines to the same
column position for easier reading. This feature isn't supported by this
check, so both braces in the following case will be reported as violations.



public long toNanos(long d)  { return d;             } // 2 violations
public long toMicros(long d) { return d / (C1 / C0); }
[Rule]
TrailingComment
[Description]
The check to ensure that lines with code do not end with comment.
For the case of // comments that means that the only thing
that should precede it is whitespace. It doesn't check comments if
they do not end a line; for example, it accepts the following:
Thread.sleep( 10 /*some comment here*/ ); Format
property is intended to deal with the } // while example.


Rationale: Steve McConnell in Code Complete suggests that
endline comments are a bad practice. An end line comment would be
one that is on the same line as actual code. For example:



a = b + c;      // Some insightful comment
d = e / f;        // Another comment for this line


Quoting Code Complete for the justification:


"The comments have to be aligned so that they do not
interfere with the visual structure of the code. If you don't align
them neatly, they'll make your listing look like it's been through a
washing machine."

"Endline comments tend to be hard to format...It takes
time to align them. Such time is not spent learning more about the
code; it's dedicated solely to the tedious task of pressing the
spacebar or tab key."

"Endline comments are also hard to maintain. If the code
on any line containing an endline comment grows, it bumps the
comment farther out, and all the other endline comments will have to
bumped out to match. Styles that are hard to maintain aren't
maintained...."

"Endline comments also tend to be cryptic. The right side
of the line doesn't offer much room and the desire to keep the
comment on one line means the comment must be short. Work then goes
into making the line as short as possible instead of as clear as
possible. The comment usually ends up as cryptic as
possible...."

"A systemic problem with endline comments is that it's
hard to write a meaningful comment for one line of code. Most
endline comments just repeat the line of code, which hurts more than
it helps."



McConnell's comments on being hard to maintain when the size of the line
changes are even more important in the age of automated
refactorings.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
