For example, \"Müller's algorithm\" might become \"Muellers algorithm\". \nDivide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens). \nRecommended: if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., \"AdWords\" becomes \"ad words\"). Note that a word such as \"iOS\" is not really in camel case per se ; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply. \nNow lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of: \n... each word, to yield upper camel case , or \n... each word except the first, to yield lower camel case \nFinally, join all the words into a single identifier.\nNote that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded. Examples:\nProse form \nCorrect \nIncorrect \n\"XML HTTP request\" \n`XmlHttpRequest` \n`XMLHTTPRequest` \n\"new customer ID\" \n`newCustomerId` \n`newCustomerID` \n\"inner stopwatch\" \n`innerStopwatch` \n`innerStopWatch` \n\"supports IPv6 on iOS?\" \n`supportsIpv6OnIos` \n`supportsIPv6OnIOS` \n\"YouTube importer\" \n`YouTubeImporter` \n`YoutubeImporter` *\n*Acceptable, but not recommended.\nNote: Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for example \"nonempty\" and \"non-empty\" are both correct, so the method names `checkNonempty` and `checkNonEmpty` are likewise both correct."
