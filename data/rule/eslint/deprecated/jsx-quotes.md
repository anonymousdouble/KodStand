This rule was deprecated in ESLint v8.53.0. Please use the corresponding rule  in @stylistic/eslint-plugin-js .
JSX attribute values can contain string literals, which are delimited with single or double quotes.

```json
<a b='c' />;
<a b="c" />;
```
Unlike string literals in JavaScript, string literals within JSX attributes canâ€™t contain escaped quotes.
If you want to have e.g. a double quote within a JSX attribute value, you have to use single quotes as string delimiter.

```json
<a b="'" />;
<a b='"' />;
```
## Rule Details
This rule enforces the consistent use of either double or single quotes in JSX attributes.
## Options
This rule has a string option:

`"prefer-double"` (default) enforces the use of double quotes for all JSX attribute values that donâ€™t contain a double quote.
`"prefer-single"` enforces the use of single quotes for all JSX attribute values that donâ€™t contain a single quote.

### prefer-double
