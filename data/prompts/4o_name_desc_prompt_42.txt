Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
5.3 Camel case: defined
Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case, such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like "IPv6" or "iOS" are present. To improve predictability, Google Style specifies the following (nearly) deterministic scheme.
 Beginning with the prose form of the name:
 Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, "M¨¹ller's algorithm" might become "Muellers algorithm". 
 Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens). 
 Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., "AdWords" becomes "ad words"). Note that a word such as "iOS" is not really in camel case per se ; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply. 
 Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of: 
 ... each word, to yield upper camel case , or 
 ... each word except the first, to yield lower camel case 
 Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.
 Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded. Examples:
 Prose form 
 Correct 
 Incorrect 
 "XML HTTP request" 
 `XmlHttpRequest` 
 `XMLHTTPRequest` 
 "new customer ID" 
 `newCustomerId` 
 `newCustomerID` 
 "inner stopwatch" 
 `innerStopwatch` 
 `innerStopWatch` 
 "supports IPv6 on iOS?" 
 `supportsIpv6OnIos` 
 `supportsIPv6OnIOS` 
 "YouTube importer" 
 `YouTubeImporter` 
 `YoutubeImporter` *
 *Acceptable, but not recommended.
 Note: Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for example "nonempty" and "non-empty" are both correct, so the method names `checkNonempty` and `checkNonEmpty` are likewise both correct.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
AbbreviationAsWordInName
[Description]
Validates abbreviations (consecutive capital letters) length in identifier name,
it also allows to enforce camel case naming. Please read more at

Google Style Guide
to get to know how to avoid long abbreviations in names.

'_' is considered as word separator in identifier name.

allowedAbbreviationLength specifies how many consecutive capital letters are
allowed in the identifier.
A value of 3 indicates that up to 4 consecutive capital letters are allowed,
one after the other, before a violation is printed. The identifier 'MyTEST' would be
allowed, but 'MyTESTS' would not be.
A value of 0 indicates that only 1 consecutive capital letter is allowed. This
is what should be used to enforce strict camel casing. The identifier 'MyTest' would
be allowed, but 'MyTEst' would not be.


ignoreFinal, ignoreStatic, and ignoreStaticFinal
control whether variables with the respective modifiers are to be ignored.
Note that a variable that is both static and final will always be considered under
ignoreStaticFinal only, regardless of the values of ignoreFinal
and ignoreStatic. So for example if ignoreStatic is true but
ignoreStaticFinal is false, then static final variables will not be ignored.
[Rule]
PackageName
[Description]
Checks that package names conform to a specified pattern.


The default value of format for module PackageName has been
chosen to match the requirements in the
Java
Language specification and the Sun coding conventions. However,
both underscores and uppercase letters are rather uncommon, so most
configurations should probably assign value ^[a-z]+(\.[a-z][a-z0-9]*)*$ to
format for module PackageName.
[Rule]
CatchParameterName
[Description]
Checks that catch parameter names conform to a specified pattern.


Default pattern has the following characteristic:


allows names beginning with two lowercase letters followed by at least one uppercase
or lowercase letter
allows e abbreviation (suitable for exceptions end errors)
allows ex abbreviation (suitable for exceptions)
allows t abbreviation (suitable for throwables)
prohibits numbered abbreviations like e1 or t2
prohibits one letter prefixes like pException
prohibits two letter abbreviations like ie or ee
prohibits any other characters than letters
[Rule]
IllegalIdentifierName
[Description]
Checks identifiers with a pattern for a set of illegal names, such as those
that are restricted or contextual keywords. Examples include "yield", "record",
"_", and "var". Please read more at

Java Language Specification
to get to know more about restricted keywords. Since this check uses a
pattern to specify valid identifiers, users can also prohibit the usage
of certain symbols, such as "$", or any non-ascii character.
[Rule]
HideUtilityClassConstructor
[Description]
Makes sure that utility classes (classes that contain only static
methods or fields in their API) do not have a public constructor.


Rationale: Instantiating utility classes does not make sense. Hence,
the constructors should either be private or (if you want to allow
subclassing) protected. A common mistake is forgetting to hide the
default constructor.


If you make the constructor protected you may want to consider the
following constructor implementation technique to disallow
instantiating subclasses:



public class StringUtils // not final to allow subclassing
{
protected StringUtils() {
// prevents calls from subclass
throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

public static int count(char c, String s) {
// ...
}
}
[Rule]
AvoidInlineConditionals
[Description]
Detects inline conditionals. Here is one example of an inline conditional:



String a = getParameter("a");
String b = (a==null || a.length()<1) ? null : a.substring(1);


Rationale: Some developers find inline conditionals hard to read, so
their employer's coding standards forbid them.
[Rule]
MethodName
[Description]
Checks that method names conform to a specified pattern.


Also, checks if a method name has the same name as the residing class.
The default is false (it is not allowed). It is legal in Java to have
method with the same name as a class. As long as a return type is specified
it is a method and not a constructor which it could be easily confused as.
Does not check-style the name of an overridden methods because the developer
does not have a choice in renaming such methods.
[Rule]
UpperEll
[Description]
Checks that long constants are defined with an upper ell. That
is 'L' and not 'l'. This is in accordance with the Java
Language Specification,

Section 3.10.1.


Rationale: The lower-case ell 'l' looks a lot like 1.
[Rule]
IllegalInstantiation
[Description]
Checks for illegal instantiations where a factory method is
preferred.


Rationale: Depending on the project, for some classes it might be
preferable to create instances through factory methods rather than
calling the constructor.


A simple example is the java.lang.Boolean
class. For performance reasons, it is preferable to
use the predefined constants  TRUE and
FALSE. Constructor invocations should be
replaced by calls to Boolean.valueOf().


Some extremely performance sensitive projects may require the use of
factory methods for other classes as well, to enforce the usage of
number caches or object pools.
[Rule]
ModifierOrder
[Description]
Checks that the order of modifiers conforms to the suggestions in
the Java
Language specification, ¡ì 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3 and

9.4. The correct order is:



public


protected


private


abstract


default


static


sealed


non-sealed


final


transient


volatile


synchronized


native


strictfp



In additional, modifiers are checked to ensure all annotations are
declared before all other modifiers.


Rationale: Code is easier to read if everybody follows a standard.


ATTENTION: We skip

type annotations from validation.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
