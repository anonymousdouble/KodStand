Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.8.4.2 Fall-through: commented
Within a switch block, each statement group either terminates abruptly (with a break, continue, return or thrown exception), or is marked with a comment to indicate that execution will or might continue into the next statement group. Any comment that communicates the idea of fall-through is sufficient (typically // fall through). This special comment is not required in the last statement group of the switch block. Example:
 switch (input) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  prepareOneOrTwo();
  // fall through
  case 3:
  handleOneTwoOrThree();
  break;
  default:
  handleLargeNumber(input);
 }
 Notice that no comment is needed after case 1:, only at the end of the statement group.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
FallThrough
[Description]
Checks for fall-through in switch
statements. Finds locations where a case
contains Java code but lacks a break, return,
yield, throw or continue
statement.


The check honors special comments to suppress the warning.
By default, the texts
"fallthru", "fall thru", "fall-thru",
"fallthrough", "fall through", "fall-through"
"fallsthrough", "falls through", "falls-through" (case-sensitive).
The comment containing these words must be all on one line,
and must be on the last non-empty line before the
case triggering the warning or on
the same line before the case
(ugly, but possible).


Note: The check assumes that there is no unreachable
code in the case.
[Rule]
EmptyBlock
[Description]
Checks for empty blocks. This check does not validate sequential blocks.
Sequential blocks won't be checked. Also, no violations for fallthrough:


switch (a) {
case 1:                          // no violation
case 2:                          // no violation
case 3: someMethod(); { }        // no violation
default: break;
}


NOTE: This check processes LITERAL_CASE and LITERAL_DEFAULT separately.
Verification empty block is done for single nearest {@code case} or {@code default}.
[Rule]
AvoidNestedBlocks
[Description]
Finds nested blocks (blocks that are used freely in the code).


Rationale: Nested blocks are often leftovers from the
debugging process, they confuse the reader.


For example, this check finds the obsolete braces in



public void guessTheOutput()
{
int whichIsWhich = 0;
{
whichIsWhich = 2;
}
System.out.println("value = " + whichIsWhich);
}

and debugging / refactoring leftovers such as


// if (conditionThatIsNotUsedAnyLonger)
{
System.out.println("unconditional");
}


A case in a switch statement does not implicitly form a block.
Thus, to be able to introduce local variables that have case
scope it is necessary to open a nested block. This is
supported, set the allowInSwitchCase property to true and
include all statements of the case in the block.
[Rule]
DefaultComesLast
[Description]
Check that the default is after all the
cases in a switch statement.


Rationale: Java allows default anywhere
within the switch statement. But it is
more readable if it comes after the last case.
[Rule]
TrailingComment
[Description]
The check to ensure that lines with code do not end with comment.
For the case of // comments that means that the only thing
that should precede it is whitespace. It doesn't check comments if
they do not end a line; for example, it accepts the following:
Thread.sleep( 10 /*some comment here*/ ); Format
property is intended to deal with the } // while example.


Rationale: Steve McConnell in Code Complete suggests that
endline comments are a bad practice. An end line comment would be
one that is on the same line as actual code. For example:



a = b + c;      // Some insightful comment
d = e / f;        // Another comment for this line


Quoting Code Complete for the justification:


"The comments have to be aligned so that they do not
interfere with the visual structure of the code. If you don't align
them neatly, they'll make your listing look like it's been through a
washing machine."

"Endline comments tend to be hard to format...It takes
time to align them. Such time is not spent learning more about the
code; it's dedicated solely to the tedious task of pressing the
spacebar or tab key."

"Endline comments are also hard to maintain. If the code
on any line containing an endline comment grows, it bumps the
comment farther out, and all the other endline comments will have to
bumped out to match. Styles that are hard to maintain aren't
maintained...."

"Endline comments also tend to be cryptic. The right side
of the line doesn't offer much room and the desire to keep the
comment on one line means the comment must be short. Work then goes
into making the line as short as possible instead of as clear as
possible. The comment usually ends up as cryptic as
possible...."

"A systemic problem with endline comments is that it's
hard to write a meaningful comment for one line of code. Most
endline comments just repeat the line of code, which hurts more than
it helps."



McConnell's comments on being hard to maintain when the size of the line
changes are even more important in the age of automated
refactorings.
[Rule]
MissingSwitchDefault
[Description]
Checks that switch statement has a default clause.


Rationale: It's usually a good idea to introduce a default case in
every switch statement. Even if the developer is sure that all
currently possible cases are covered, this should be expressed in
the default branch, e.g. by using an assertion. This way the code is
protected against later changes, e.g. introduction of new types in an
enumeration type.


This check does not validate any switch expressions. Rationale:
The compiler requires switch expressions to be exhaustive. This means
that all possible inputs must be covered.


This check does not validate switch statements that use pattern or null
labels. Rationale: Switch statements that use pattern or null labels are
checked by the compiler for exhaustiveness. This means that all possible
inputs must be covered.


See the

Java Language Specification for more information about switch statements
and expressions.
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Rule]
AvoidInlineConditionals
[Description]
Detects inline conditionals. Here is one example of an inline conditional:



String a = getParameter("a");
String b = (a==null || a.length()<1) ? null : a.substring(1);


Rationale: Some developers find inline conditionals hard to read, so
their employer's coding standards forbid them.
[Rule]
RightCurly
[Description]
Checks the placement of right curly braces ('}') for code blocks.
This check supports if-else, try-catch-finally blocks, switch statements, switch cases,
while-loops, for-loops, method definitions, class definitions, constructor definitions,
instance, static initialization blocks, annotation definitions and enum definitions.
For right curly brace of expression blocks of arrays, lambdas and class instances
please follow issue
#5945.
For right curly brace of enum constant please follow issue
#7519.
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
