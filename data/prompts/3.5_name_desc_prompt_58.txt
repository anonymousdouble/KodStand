Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.8.5.5 Parameter and local variable annotations
There are no specific rules for formatting annotations on parameters or local variables (except, of course, when the annotation is a type-use annotation).

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
UnusedLocalVariable
[Description]
Checks that a local variable is declared and/or assigned, but not used.
Doesn't support pattern variables yet.
Doesn't check array components as array
components are classified as different kind of variables by JLS.
[Rule]
ModifierOrder
[Description]
Checks that the order of modifiers conforms to the suggestions in
the Java
Language specification, ¡ì 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3 and

9.4. The correct order is:



public


protected


private


abstract


default


static


sealed


non-sealed


final


transient


volatile


synchronized


native


strictfp



In additional, modifiers are checked to ensure all annotations are
declared before all other modifiers.


Rationale: Code is easier to read if everybody follows a standard.


ATTENTION: We skip

type annotations from validation.
[Rule]
AnnotationLocation
[Description]
Checks location of annotation on language elements.
By default, Check enforce to locate annotations immediately after documentation block
and before target element, annotation should be located on separate line from target
element. This check also verifies that the annotations are on the same indenting level as
the annotated element if they are not on the same line.


Attention: Elements that cannot have JavaDoc comments like local variables are not in the
scope of this check even though a token type like VARIABLE_DEF would match
them.


Attention: Annotations among modifiers are ignored (looks like false-negative)
as there might be a problem with annotations for return types:


public @Nullable Long getStartTimeOrNull() { ... }

Such annotations are better to keep close to type.
Due to limitations, Checkstyle can not examine the target of an annotation.


Example:



@Override
@Nullable
public String getNameIfPresent() { ... }
[Rule]
AnnotationOnSameLine
[Description]
Checks that annotations are located on the same line with their targets.
Verifying with this check is not good practice, but it is using by some style guides.
[Rule]
LocalVariableName
[Description]
Checks that local, non-final variable names conform to a specified pattern.
A catch parameter is considered to be a local variable.
[Rule]
ParameterAssignment
[Description]
Disallows assignment of parameters.

Rationale: Parameter assignment is often considered poor programming
practice. Forcing developers to declare parameters as final is often
onerous. Having a check ensure that parameters are never assigned
would give the best of both worlds.
[Rule]
PackageAnnotation
[Description]
Checks that all package annotations are in the package-info.java file.


For Java SE8 and above, placement of package annotations in the package-info.java
file is enforced by the compiler and this check is not necessary.


For Java SE7 and below, the Java Language Specification highly recommends
but doesn't require that annotations are placed in the package-info.java file,
and this check can help to enforce that placement.


See
Java Language Specification, ¡ì7.4.1 for more info.
[Rule]
FinalParameters
[Description]
Checks that parameters for methods, constructors, catch and for-each blocks are
final. Interface, abstract, and native methods are not checked: the final
keyword does not make sense for interface, abstract, and native method
parameters as there is no code that could modify the parameter.


Rationale: Changing the value of parameters during the execution of
the method's algorithm can be confusing and should be avoided. A
great way to let the Java compiler prevent this coding style is to
declare parameters final.
[Rule]
FinalLocalVariable
[Description]
Checks that local variables that never have their values changed are
declared final. The check can be configured to also check that
unchanged parameters are declared final.
[Rule]
OneTopLevelClass
[Description]
Checks that each top-level class, interface, enum
or annotation resides in a source file of its own.
Official description of a 'top-level' term:
7.6. Top Level Type Declarations.
If file doesn't contain public class, interface, enum or annotation,
top-level type is the first type in file.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
