## Overview
Require template literals instead of string concatenation


ðŸ”§ Fixable

            Some problems reported by this rule are automatically fixable by the `--fix` command line  option
        


In ES2015 (ES6), we can use template literals instead of string concatenation.

```json
var str = "Hello, " + name + "!";
```

```json
/*eslint-env es6*/

var str = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```
## Rule Details
This rule is aimed to flag usage of `+` operators with strings.
## Examples
Examples of incorrect code for this rule:


```json
/*eslint prefer-template: "error"*/

var str = "Hello, " + name + "!";
var str = "Time: " + (12 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```
Examples of correct code for this rule:


```json
/*eslint prefer-template: "error"*/
/*eslint-env es6*/

var str = "Hello World!";
var str = `Hello, ${name}!`;
var str = `Time: ${12 * 60 * 60 * 1000}`;

// This is reported by `no-useless-concat`.
var str = "Hello, " + "World!";
```
## When Not To Use It
This rule should not be used in ES3/5 environments.
In ES2015 (ES6) or later, if you donâ€™t want to be notified about string concatenation, you can safely disable this rule.
