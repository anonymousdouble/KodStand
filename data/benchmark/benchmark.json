For example, \"Müller's algorithm\" might become \"Muellers algorithm\". \n Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens). \n Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., \"AdWords\" becomes \"ad words\"). Note that a word such as \"iOS\" is not really in camel case per se ; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply. \n Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of: \n ... each word, to yield upper camel case , or \n ... each word except the first, to yield lower camel case \n Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.\n Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded. Examples:\n Prose form \n Correct \n Incorrect \n \"XML HTTP request\" \n `XmlHttpRequest` \n `XMLHTTPRequest` \n \"new customer ID\" \n `newCustomerId` \n `newCustomerID` \n \"inner stopwatch\" \n `innerStopwatch` \n `innerStopWatch` \n \"supports IPv6 on iOS?\" \n `supportsIpv6OnIos` \n `supportsIPv6OnIOS` \n \"YouTube importer\" \n `YouTubeImporter` \n `YoutubeImporter` *\n *Acceptable, but not recommended.\n Note: Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for example \"nonempty\" and \"non-empty\" are both correct, so the method names `checkNonempty` and `checkNonEmpty` are likewise both correct.": [
