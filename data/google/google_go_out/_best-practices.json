                "description": "\n    If you’re asking yourself how big your Go packages should be and whether to\n            place related types in the same package or split them into different ones, a\n            good place to start is the\n    \n     Go blog post about package names\n    \n    .\n            Despite the post title, it’s not solely about naming. It contains some helpful\n            hints and cites several useful articles and talks.\n   \n    Here are some other considerations and notes.\n   \n    Users see\n    \n     godoc\n    \n    for the package in one page, and any methods exported by types\n            supplied by the package are grouped by their type. Godoc also group constructors\n            along with the types they return. If\n    \n     client code\n    \n    is likely to need two values\n            of different type to interact with each other, it may be convenient for the user\n            to have them in the same package.\n   \n    Code within a package can access unexported identifiers in the package. If you\n            have a few related types whose\n    \n     implementation\n    \n    is tightly coupled, placing them\n            in the same package lets you achieve this coupling without polluting the public\n            API with these details. A good test for this coupling is to imagine a\n            hypothetical user of two packages, where the packages cover closely related\n            topics: if the user must import both packages in order to use either in any\n            meaningful way, combining them together is usually the right thing to do. The\n            standard library generally demonstrates this kind of scoping and layering well.\n   \n    All of that being said, putting your entire project in a single package would\n            likely make that package too large. When something is conceptually distinct,\n            giving it its own small package can make it easier to use. The short name of the\n            package as known to clients together with the exported type name work together\n            to make a meaningful identifier: e.g.\n    \n     bytes.Buffer\n    \n    ,\n    \n     ring.New\n    \n    . The\n    \n     blog post\n    \n    has more examples.\n   \n    Go style is flexible about file size, because maintainers can move code within a\n            package from one file to another without affecting callers. But as a general\n            guideline: it is usually not a good idea to have a single file with many\n            thousands of lines in it, or having many tiny files. There is no “one type, one\n            file” convention as in some other languages. As a rule of thumb, files should be\n            focused enough that a maintainer can tell which file contains something, and the\n            files should be small enough that it will be easy to find once there. The\n            standard library often splits large packages to several source files, grouping\n            related code by file. The source for\n    \n     package\n     \n      bytes\n     \n\n    is a good example.\n            Packages with long package documentation may choose to dedicate one file called\n    \n     doc.go\n    \n    that has the\n    \n     package documentation\n    \n    , a\n            package declaration, and nothing else, but this is not required.\n   \n    Within the Google codebase and in projects using Bazel, directory layout for Go\n            code is different than it is in open source Go projects: you can have multiple\n    \n     go_library\n    \n    targets in a single directory. A good reason to give each package\n            its own directory is if you expect to open source your project in the future.\n   \n    See also:\n   \n\n\n      Test double packages\n     \n\n\n\n\n",

Logging is an obvious choice here; but be\n            conscious of what and how you log errors.\n   \n\n\n      Like\n      \n       good test failure messages\n      \n      , log messages should clearly express what\n                    went wrong and help the maintainer by including relevant information to\n                    diagnose the problem.\n     \n\n\n\n      Avoid duplication. If you return an error, it’s usually better not to log it\n                    yourself but rather let the caller handle it. The caller can choose to log\n                    the error, or perhaps rate-limit logging using\n      \n\n        rate.Sometimes\n       \n\n      . Other\n                    options include attempting recovery or even\n      \n       stopping the program\n      \n      . In any\n                    case, giving the caller control helps avoid logspam.\n     \n\n      The downside to this approach, however, is that any logging is written using\n                    the caller’s line coordinates.\n     \n\n\n\n      Be careful with\n      \n       PII\n      \n      .

Libraries should prefer returning an\n            error to the caller rather than aborting the program, especially for transient\n            errors.\n   \n    It is occasionally necessary to perform consistency checks on an invariant and\n            terminate the program if it is violated. In general, this is only done when a\n            failure of the invariant check means that the internal state has become\n            unrecoverable. The most reliable way to do this in the Google codebase is to\n            call\n    \n     log.Fatal\n    \n    . Using\n    \n     panic\n    \n    in these cases is not reliable, because it is\n            possible for deferred functions to deadlock or further corrupt internal or\n            external state.\n   \n    Similarly, resist the temptation to recover panics to avoid crashes, as doing so\n            can result in propagating a corrupted state. The further you are from the panic,\n            the less you know about the state of the program, which could be holding locks\n            or other resources. The program can then develop other unexpected failure modes\n            that can make the problem even more difficult to diagnose. Instead of trying to\n            handle unexpected panics in code, use monitoring tools to surface unexpected\n            failures and fix related bugs with a high priority.\n   \n\n     Note:\n    \n    The standard\n    \n\n      net/http\n     \n     server\n    \n    violates this advice and recovers\n            panics from request handlers.

This is analogous to the panics on core language bugs such as\n            accessing an element of a slice that is out of bounds. Code review and tests\n            should discover such bugs, which are not expected to appear in production code.\n            These panics act as invariant checks that do not depend on a library, as the\n            standard library does not have access to the\n    \n     levelled\n     \n      log\n     \n\n    package that the\n            Google codebase uses.\n   \n    Another case in which panics can be useful, though uncommon, is as an internal\n            implementation detail of a package which always has a matching recover in the\n            callchain.

The\n            alternative makes it much more difficult for users who must programmatically\n            choose which options to pass; such users are forced to change the actual\n            composition of the parameters rather than simply changing the arguments to the\n            options. Don’t assume that all users will know the full set of options\n            statically.\n   \n    In general, options should be processed in order. If there is a conflict or if a\n            non-cumulative option is passed multiple times, the last argument should win.\n   \n    The parameter to the option function is generally unexported in this pattern, to\n            restrict the options to being defined only within the package itself. This is a\n            good default, though there may be times when it is appropriate to allow other\n            packages to define options.\n   \n    See\n    \n     Rob Pike’s original blog post\n    \n    and\n    \n     Dave Cheney’s talk\n    \n    for a more in-depth\n            look at how these options can be used.\n   \n\n\n",

Assertion helpers are\n      \n       not considered idiomatic\n      \n      in Go.\n     \n\n\n    The purpose of a test is to report pass/fail conditions of the code under test.\n            The ideal place to fail a test is within the\n    \n     Test\n    \n    function itself, as that\n            ensures that\n    \n     failure messages\n    \n    and the test logic are clear.\n   \n    As your testing code grows, it may become necessary to factor out some\n            functionality to separate functions. Standard software engineering\n            considerations still apply, as\n    \n     test code is still code\n    \n    . If the functionality\n            does not interact with the testing framework, then all of the usual rules apply.\n            When the common code interacts with the framework, however, some care must be\n            taken to avoid common pitfalls that can lead to uninformative failure messages\n            and unmaintainable tests.\n   \n    If many separate test cases require the same validation logic, arrange the test\n            in one of the following ways instead of using assertion helpers or complex\n            validation functions:\n   \n\n     Inline the logic (both the validation and the failure) in the\n     \n      Test\n     \n     function, even if it is repetitive. This works best in simple cases.\n    \n\n     If inputs are similar, consider unifying them into a\n     \n      table-driven test\n     \n     while keeping the logic inlined in the loop. This helps to avoid repetition\n                while keeping the validation and failure in the\n     \n      Test\n     \n     .\n    \n\n     If there are multiple callers who need the same validation function but\n                table tests are not suitable (typically because the inputs are not simple\n                enough or the validation is required as part of a sequence of operations),\n                arrange the validation function so that it returns a value (typically an\n     \n      error\n     \n     ) rather than taking a\n     \n      testing.T\n     \n     parameter and using it to fail the\n                test. Use logic within the\n     \n      Test\n     \n     to decide whether to fail, and to provide\n     \n      useful test failures\n     \n     . You can also create test helpers to factor out\n                common boilerplate setup code.\n    \n\n    The design outlined in the last point maintains orthogonality. For example,\n    \n     package\n     \n      cmp\n     \n\n    is not designed to fail tests, but rather to compare (and to\n            diff) values. It therefore does not need to know about the context in which the\n            comparison was made, since the caller can supply that. If your common testing\n            code provides a\n    \n     cmp.Transformer\n    \n    for your data type, that can often be the\n            simplest design.

This API treats the implementation as a blackbox to make sure\n            it upholds the most basic parts of the\n    \n     io/fs\n    \n    contract.\n   \n\n\n",

Users of\n    \n     chess\n    \n    are expected to implement the\n    \n     chess.Player\n    \n    interface. These implementations are the primary thing we will\n            validate. Our acceptance test concerns itself with whether the player\n            implementation makes legal moves, not whether the moves are smart.\n   \n\n\n      Create a new package for the validation behavior,\n      \n       customarily named\n      \n      by appending the word\n      \n       test\n      \n      to the package name (for example,\n      \n       chesstest\n      \n      ).\n     \n\n\n\n      Create the function that performs the validation by accepting the\n                    implementation under test as an argument and exercises it:\n     \n\n\n// ExercisePlayer tests a Player implementation in a single turn on a board.\n// The board itself is spot checked for sensibility and correctness.\n//\n// It returns a nil error if the player makes a correct move in the context\n// of the provided board. Otherwise ExercisePlayer returns one of this\n// package's errors to indicate how and why the player failed the\n// validation.\nfunc ExercisePlayer(b *chess.Board, p chess.Player) error\n\n\n\n\n      The test should note which invariants are broken and how. Your design can\n                    choose between two disciplines for failure reporting:\n     \n\n\n\n\n         Fail fast\n        \n        : return an error as soon as the implementation violates an\n                            invariant.\n       \n\n        This is the simplest approach, and it works well if the acceptance test\n                            is expected to execute quickly. Simple error\n        \n         sentinels\n        \n        and\n        \n         custom types\n        \n        can be used easily here, which conversely makes testing\n                            the acceptance test easy.\n       \n\n\nfor color, army := range b.Armies {\n    // The king should never leave the board, because the game ends at\n    // checkmate.\n    if army.King == nil {\n        return &MissingPieceError{Color: color, Piece: chess.King}\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Aggregate all failures\n        \n        : collect all failures, and report them all.\n       \n\n        This approach resembles the\n        \n         keep going\n        \n        guidance\n                            in feel and may be preferable if the acceptance test is expected to\n                            execute slowly.\n       \n\n        How you aggregate the failures should be dictated by whether you want to\n                            give users the ability or yourself the ability to interrogate individual\n                            failures (for example, for you to test your acceptance test).

But do not\n            attempt to use it to bypass the\n    \n     guidance on assertions\n    \n    .\n   \n    The final product should be in a form similar to this for end users:\n   \n\n// Good:\npackage deepblue_test\n\nimport (\n    \"chesstest\"\n    \"deepblue\"\n)\n\nfunc TestAcceptance(t *testing.T) {\n    player := deepblue.New()\n    err := chesstest.ExerciseGame(t, chesstest.SimpleGame, player)\n    if err != nil {\n        t.Errorf(\"Deep Blue player failed acceptance test: %v\", err)\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For example, a public\n                function may use a private global variable as a cache, but so long as the\n                caller can’t distinguish cache hits from misses, the function is stateless.\n    \n\n     The global state does not bleed into things that are external to the\n                program, like sidecar processes or files on a shared filesystem.\n    \n\n     There is no expectation of predictable behavior\n                (\n     \n      example\n     \n     ).\n    \n\n\n\n      Note:\n     \n\n      Sidecar processes\n     \n     may\n     \n      not\n     \n     strictly be process-local. They can and often are shared with more\n                than one application process. Moreover, these sidecars often interact with\n                external distributed systems.\n    \n\n     Further, the same stateless, idempotent, and local rules in addition to the\n                base considerations above would apply to the code of the sidecar process\n                itself!\n    \n\n    An example of one of these safe situations is\n    \n\n      package image\n     \n\n    with its\n    \n\n      image.RegisterFormat\n     \n\n    function.\n            Consider the litmus tests from above applied to a typical decoder, like the one\n            for handling the\n    \n     PNG\n    \n    format:\n   \n\n     Multiple calls to\n     \n      package image\n     \n     ’s APIs that use the registered decoders\n                (for example,\n     \n      image.Decode\n     \n     ) cannot interfere with one another, similarly\n                for tests. The only exception is\n     \n      image.RegisterFormat\n     \n     , but that is\n                mitigated by the points below.\n    \n\n     It is extremely unlikely that a user would want to replace a decoder with a\n     \n      test double\n     \n     , as the PNG decoder exemplifies a case in which our codebase’s\n                preference for real objects applies. However, a user would be more likely to\n                replace a decoder with a test double if the decoder statefully interacted\n                with operating system resources (for example, the network).\n    \n\n     Collisions in registration are conceivable, though they are probably rare in\n                practice.\n    \n\n     The decoders are stateless, idempotent, and pure.\n    \n\n\n\n",
