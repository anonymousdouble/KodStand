Regular expressions can be very complex and difficult to understand, which is why itâ€™s important to keep them as simple as possible in order to avoid mistakes. One of the more error-prone things you can do with a regular expression is to use more than one space, such as:

```json
var re = /foo   bar/;
```
In this regular expression, itâ€™s very hard to tell how many spaces are intended to be matched. Itâ€™s better to use only one space and then specify how many spaces are expected, such as:

```json
var re = /foo {3}bar/;
```
Now it is very clear that three spaces are expected to be matched.
## Rule Details

Examples of incorrect code for this rule:
