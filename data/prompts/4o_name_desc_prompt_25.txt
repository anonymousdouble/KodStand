Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.6.3 Horizontal alignment: never required
Terminology Note: 
 Horizontal alignment is the practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.
 This practice is permitted, but is never required by Google Style. It is not even required to maintain horizontal alignment in places where it was already used.
 Here is an example without alignment, then using alignment:
 private int x; // this is fine
 private Color color; // this too
 

 private int  x; // permitted, but future edits
 private Color color; // may leave it unaligned
 

 Tip: Alignment can aid readability, but it creates problems for future maintenance. Consider a future change that needs to touch just one line. This change may leave the formerly-pleasing formatting mangled, and that is allowed . More often it prompts the coder (perhaps you) to adjust whitespace on nearby lines as well, possibly triggering a cascading series of reformattings. That one-line change now has a "blast radius." This can at worst result in pointless busywork, but at best it still corrupts version history information, slows down reviewers and exacerbates merge conflicts.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
SingleSpaceSeparator
[Description]
Checks that non-whitespace characters are separated by no more than one
whitespace. Separating characters by tabs or multiple spaces will be
reported. Currently, the check doesn't permit horizontal alignment. To inspect
whitespaces before and after comments, set the property
validateComments to true.


Setting validateComments to false will ignore cases like:



int i;  // Multiple whitespaces before comment tokens will be ignored.
private void foo(int  /* whitespaces before and after block-comments will be
ignored */  i) {


Sometimes, users like to space similar items on different lines to the same
column position for easier reading. This feature isn't supported by this
check, so both braces in the following case will be reported as violations.



public long toNanos(long d)  { return d;             } // 2 violations
public long toMicros(long d) { return d / (C1 / C0); }
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Rule]
AnnotationLocation
[Description]
Checks location of annotation on language elements.
By default, Check enforce to locate annotations immediately after documentation block
and before target element, annotation should be located on separate line from target
element. This check also verifies that the annotations are on the same indenting level as
the annotated element if they are not on the same line.


Attention: Elements that cannot have JavaDoc comments like local variables are not in the
scope of this check even though a token type like VARIABLE_DEF would match
them.


Attention: Annotations among modifiers are ignored (looks like false-negative)
as there might be a problem with annotations for return types:


public @Nullable Long getStartTimeOrNull() { ... }

Such annotations are better to keep close to type.
Due to limitations, Checkstyle can not examine the target of an annotation.


Example:



@Override
@Nullable
public String getNameIfPresent() { ... }
[Rule]
AvoidInlineConditionals
[Description]
Detects inline conditionals. Here is one example of an inline conditional:



String a = getParameter("a");
String b = (a==null || a.length()<1) ? null : a.substring(1);


Rationale: Some developers find inline conditionals hard to read, so
their employer's coding standards forbid them.
[Rule]
TrailingComment
[Description]
The check to ensure that lines with code do not end with comment.
For the case of // comments that means that the only thing
that should precede it is whitespace. It doesn't check comments if
they do not end a line; for example, it accepts the following:
Thread.sleep( 10 /*some comment here*/ ); Format
property is intended to deal with the } // while example.


Rationale: Steve McConnell in Code Complete suggests that
endline comments are a bad practice. An end line comment would be
one that is on the same line as actual code. For example:



a = b + c;      // Some insightful comment
d = e / f;        // Another comment for this line


Quoting Code Complete for the justification:


"The comments have to be aligned so that they do not
interfere with the visual structure of the code. If you don't align
them neatly, they'll make your listing look like it's been through a
washing machine."

"Endline comments tend to be hard to format...It takes
time to align them. Such time is not spent learning more about the
code; it's dedicated solely to the tedious task of pressing the
spacebar or tab key."

"Endline comments are also hard to maintain. If the code
on any line containing an endline comment grows, it bumps the
comment farther out, and all the other endline comments will have to
bumped out to match. Styles that are hard to maintain aren't
maintained...."

"Endline comments also tend to be cryptic. The right side
of the line doesn't offer much room and the desire to keep the
comment on one line means the comment must be short. Work then goes
into making the line as short as possible instead of as clear as
possible. The comment usually ends up as cryptic as
possible...."

"A systemic problem with endline comments is that it's
hard to write a meaningful comment for one line of code. Most
endline comments just repeat the line of code, which hurts more than
it helps."



McConnell's comments on being hard to maintain when the size of the line
changes are even more important in the age of automated
refactorings.
[Rule]
WhitespaceAround
[Description]
Checks that a token is surrounded by whitespace. Empty constructor,
method, class, enum, interface, loop bodies (blocks), lambdas of the form


public MyClass() {}      // empty constructor
public void func() {}    // empty method
public interface Foo {} // empty interface
public class Foo {} // empty class
public enum Foo {} // empty enum
MyClass c = new MyClass() {}; // empty anonymous class
while (i = 1) {} // empty while loop
for (int i = 1; i > 1; i++) {} // empty for loop
do {} while (i = 1); // empty do-while loop
Runnable noop = () -> {}; // empty lambda
public @interface Beta {} // empty annotation type


may optionally be exempted from the policy using the
allowEmptyMethods, allowEmptyConstructors,
allowEmptyTypes, allowEmptyLoops,
allowEmptyLambdas and allowEmptyCatches
properties.

This check does not flag as violation double brace initialization like:



new Properties() {{
setProperty("key", "value");
}};


Parameter allowEmptyCatches allows to suppress violations when token
list contains SLIST to check if beginning of block is surrounded by
whitespace and catch block is empty, for example:



try {
k = 5 / i;
} catch (ArithmeticException ex) {}



With this property turned off, this raises violation because the beginning of the
catch block (left curly bracket) is not separated from the end of the catch
block (right curly bracket).
[Rule]
JavadocContentLocation
[Description]
Checks that the Javadoc content begins from the same position
for all Javadoc comments in the project. Any leading asterisks and spaces
are not counted as the beginning of the content and are therefore ignored.


It is possible to enforce two different styles:



{@code first_line} - Javadoc content starts from the first line:



/** Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();



{@code second_line} - Javadoc content starts from the second line:



/**
* Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Rule]
GenericWhitespace
[Description]
Checks that the whitespace around the Generic tokens (angle brackets)
"<" and ">" are correct to the typical convention.
The convention is not configurable.


Left angle bracket ("<"):


should be preceded with whitespace only in generic methods definitions.
should not be preceded with whitespace when it is preceded method name
or constructor.
should not be preceded with whitespace when following type name.
should not be followed with whitespace in all cases.


Right angle bracket (">"):


should not be preceded with whitespace in all cases.
should be followed with whitespace in almost all cases, except diamond operators
and when preceding a method name, constructor, or record header.
[Rule]
LineLength
[Description]
Checks for long lines.


Rationale: Long lines are hard to read in printouts or if developers
have limited screen space for the source code, e.g. if the IDE
displays additional information like project tree, class hierarchy,
etc.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
