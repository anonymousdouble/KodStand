Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.8.5.2 Class annotations
Annotations applying to a class appear immediately after the documentation block, and each annotation is listed on a line of its own (that is, one annotation per line). These line breaks do not constitute line-wrapping (Section 4.5, Line-wrapping), so the indentation level is not increased. Example:
 @Deprecated
 @CheckReturnValue
 public final class Frozzler { ... }

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
AnnotationLocation
[Description]
Checks location of annotation on language elements.
By default, Check enforce to locate annotations immediately after documentation block
and before target element, annotation should be located on separate line from target
element. This check also verifies that the annotations are on the same indenting level as
the annotated element if they are not on the same line.


Attention: Elements that cannot have JavaDoc comments like local variables are not in the
scope of this check even though a token type like VARIABLE_DEF would match
them.


Attention: Annotations among modifiers are ignored (looks like false-negative)
as there might be a problem with annotations for return types:


public @Nullable Long getStartTimeOrNull() { ... }

Such annotations are better to keep close to type.
Due to limitations, Checkstyle can not examine the target of an annotation.


Example:



@Override
@Nullable
public String getNameIfPresent() { ... }
[Options]
allowSamelineMultipleAnnotations, Allow annotation(s) to be located on the same line as target element.
allowSamelineParameterizedAnnotation, Allow one and only parameterized annotation to be located on the same line as target element.
allowSamelineSingleParameterlessAnnotation, Allow single parameterless annotation to be located on the same line as target element.
tokens, tokens to check
[Rule]
PackageAnnotation
[Description]
Checks that all package annotations are in the package-info.java file.


For Java SE8 and above, placement of package annotations in the package-info.java
file is enforced by the compiler and this check is not necessary.


For Java SE7 and below, the Java Language Specification highly recommends
but doesn't require that annotations are placed in the package-info.java file,
and this check can help to enforce that placement.


See
Java Language Specification, ¡ì7.4.1 for more info.
[Options]
[Rule]
InvalidJavadocPosition
[Description]
Checks that Javadocs are located at the correct position.
As specified at

Documentation Comment Specification for the Standard Doclet,
Javadocs are recognized only when placed immediately before module, package, class,
interface, constructor, method, or field declarations. Any other position, like
in the body of a method, will be ignored by the javadoc tool and is considered
invalid by this check.
[Options]
[Rule]
ModifierOrder
[Description]
Checks that the order of modifiers conforms to the suggestions in
the Java
Language specification, ¡ì 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3 and

9.4. The correct order is:



public


protected


private


abstract


default


static


sealed


non-sealed


final


transient


volatile


synchronized


native


strictfp



In additional, modifiers are checked to ensure all annotations are
declared before all other modifiers.


Rationale: Code is easier to read if everybody follows a standard.


ATTENTION: We skip

type annotations from validation.
[Options]
[Rule]
OneTopLevelClass
[Description]
Checks that each top-level class, interface, enum
or annotation resides in a source file of its own.
Official description of a 'top-level' term:
7.6. Top Level Type Declarations.
If file doesn't contain public class, interface, enum or annotation,
top-level type is the first type in file.
[Options]
[Rule]
JavadocContentLocation
[Description]
Checks that the Javadoc content begins from the same position
for all Javadoc comments in the project. Any leading asterisks and spaces
are not counted as the beginning of the content and are therefore ignored.


It is possible to enforce two different styles:



{@code first_line} - Javadoc content starts from the first line:



/** Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();



{@code second_line} - Javadoc content starts from the second line:



/**
* Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();
[Options]
location, Specify the policy on placement of the Javadoc content.
[Rule]
SingleLineJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that a Javadoc block can fit in a single-line and doesn't
contain block tags. Javadoc comment that contains at least one block tag
should be formatted in a few lines.
[Options]
ignoreInlineTags, Control whether
inline tags must be ignored.
ignoredTags, Specify
block tags which are ignored by the check.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Options]
offset, Specify how many spaces to use for new indentation level.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Options]
arrayInitIndent, Specify how far an array initialization should be indented when on next line.
basicOffset, Specify how far new indentation level should be indented when on the next line.
braceAdjustment, Specify how far a braces should be indented when on the next line.
caseIndent, Specify how far a case label should be indented when on next line.
forceStrictCondition, Force strict indent level in line wrapping case. If value is true, line wrap indent have to be same as lineWrappingIndentation parameter. If value is false, line wrap indent could be bigger on any value user would like.
lineWrappingIndentation, Specify how far continuation line should be indented when line-wrapping is present.
throwsIndent, Specify how far a throws clause should be indented when on next line.
[Rule]
DesignForExtension
[Description]
Checks that classes are designed for extension (subclass creation).


Nothing wrong could be with founded classes.
This check makes sense only for library projects (not application projects)
which care of ideal OOP-design to make sure that class works in all cases even misusage.
Even in library projects this check most likely will find classes that are designed
for extension by somebody. User needs to use suppressions extensively to got a benefit
from this check, and keep in suppressions all confirmed/known classes that are deigned
for inheritance intentionally to let the check catch only new classes, and bring this to
team/user attention.


ATTENTION: Only user can decide whether a class is designed for extension or not.
The check just shows all classes which are possibly designed for extension.
If smth inappropriate is found please use suppression.


ATTENTION: If the method which can be overridden in a subclass has a javadoc comment
(a good practice is to explain its self-use of overridable methods) the check will not
rise a violation. The violation can also be skipped if the method which can be overridden
in a subclass has one or more annotations that are specified in ignoredAnnotations
option. Note, that by default @Override annotation is not included in the
ignoredAnnotations set as in a subclass the method which has the annotation can also be
overridden in its subclass.


Problem is described at "Effective Java, 2nd Edition by Joshua Bloch" book, chapter
"Item 17: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it".


Some quotes from book:

The class must document its self-use of overridable methods.
By convention, a method that invokes overridable methods contains a description
of these invocations at the end of its documentation comment. The description
begins with the phrase ¡°This implementation.¡±

The best solution to this problem is to prohibit subclassing in classes that
are not designed and documented to be safely subclassed.

If a concrete class does not implement a standard interface, then you may
inconvenience some programmers by prohibiting inheritance. If you feel that you
must allow inheritance from such a class, one reasonable approach is to ensure
that the class never invokes any of its overridable methods and to document this
fact. In other words, eliminate the class¡¯s self-use of overridable methods entirely.
In doing so, you¡¯ll create a class that is reasonably safe to subclass. Overriding a
method will never affect the behavior of any other method.


The check finds classes that have overridable methods (public or protected methods
that are non-static, not-final, non-abstract) and have non-empty implementation.


Rationale: This library design style protects superclasses against
being broken by subclasses. The downside is that subclasses are
limited in their flexibility, in particular they cannot prevent
execution of code in the superclass, but that also means that
subclasses cannot corrupt the state of the superclass by forgetting
to call the superclass's method.


More specifically,
it enforces a programming style where superclasses provide empty
"hooks" that can be implemented by subclasses.


Example of code that cause violation as it is designed for extension:



public abstract class Plant {
private String roots;
private String trunk;

protected void validate() {
if (roots == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("No roots!");
if (trunk == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("No trunk!");
}

public abstract void grow();
}

public class Tree extends Plant {
private List leaves;

@Overrides
protected void validate() {
super.validate();
if (leaves == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("No leaves!");
}

public void grow() {
validate();
}
}


Example of code without violation:



public abstract class Plant {
private String roots;
private String trunk;

private void validate() {
if (roots == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("No roots!");
if (trunk == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("No trunk!");
validateEx();
}

protected void validateEx() { }

public abstract void grow();
}
[Options]
ignoredAnnotations, Specify annotations which allow the check to skip the method from validation.
requiredJavadocPhrase, Specify the comment text pattern which qualifies a method as designed for extension. Supports multi-line regex.
