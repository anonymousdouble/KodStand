Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
7.1.1 General form
The basic formatting of Javadoc blocks is as seen in this example:
 /**
  * Multiple lines of Javadoc text are written here,
  * wrapped normally...
  */
 public int method(String p1) { ... }
 

 ... or in this single-line example:
 /** An especially short bit of Javadoc. */
 

 The basic form is always acceptable. The single-line form may be substituted when the entirety of the Javadoc block (including comment markers) can fit on a single line. Note that this only applies when there are no block tags such as `@return` .

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
SingleLineJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that a Javadoc block can fit in a single-line and doesn't
contain block tags. Javadoc comment that contains at least one block tag
should be formatted in a few lines.
[Rule]
JavadocParagraph
[Description]
Checks the Javadoc paragraph.


Checks that:



There is one blank line between each of two paragraphs.


Each paragraph but the first has <p> immediately before the first word, with
no space after.
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Rule]
JavadocContentLocation
[Description]
Checks that the Javadoc content begins from the same position
for all Javadoc comments in the project. Any leading asterisks and spaces
are not counted as the beginning of the content and are therefore ignored.


It is possible to enforce two different styles:



{@code first_line} - Javadoc content starts from the first line:



/** Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();



{@code second_line} - Javadoc content starts from the second line:



/**
* Summary text.
* More details.
*/
public void method();
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Rule]
InvalidJavadocPosition
[Description]
Checks that Javadocs are located at the correct position.
As specified at

Documentation Comment Specification for the Standard Doclet,
Javadocs are recognized only when placed immediately before module, package, class,
interface, constructor, method, or field declarations. Any other position, like
in the body of a method, will be ignored by the javadoc tool and is considered
invalid by this check.
[Rule]
JavadocBlockTagLocation
[Description]
Checks that a

javadoc block tag appears only at the beginning of a line, ignoring
leading asterisks and white space. A block tag is a token that starts
with @ symbol and is preceded by a whitespace. This check
ignores block tags in comments and inside inline tags {@code } and
{@literal }.


Rationale: according to

the specification all javadoc block tags should be placed at the
beginning of a line. Tags that are not placed at the beginning are treated
as plain text. To recognize intentional tag placement to text area
it is better to escape the @ symbol, and all non-escaped
tags should be located at the beginning of the line. See NOTE section
for details on how to escape.
[Rule]
JavadocStyle
[Description]
Validates Javadoc comments to help ensure they are well formed.


The following checks are performed:



Ensures the first sentence ends with proper punctuation
(That is a period, question mark, or exclamation mark, by default).
Note that this check is not applied to inline @return tags,
because the Javadoc tools automatically appends a period to the end of the tag
content.
Javadoc automatically places the first sentence in the
method summary table and index. Without proper punctuation
the Javadoc may be malformed. All items eligible for the
{@inheritDoc} tag are exempt from this
requirement.


Check text for Javadoc statements that do not have any
description. This includes both completely empty Javadoc,
and Javadoc with only tags such as @param and @return.


Check text for incomplete HTML tags. Verifies that HTML
tags have corresponding end tags and issues an "Unclosed
HTML tag found:" error if not. An "Extra HTML tag found:"
error is issued if an end tag is found without a previous
open tag.


Check that a package Javadoc comment is well-formed (as
described above).


Check for allowed HTML tags. The list of allowed HTML tags
is "a", "abbr", "acronym", "address", "area", "b", "bdo", "big",
"blockquote", "br", "caption", "cite", "code", "colgroup", "dd",
"del", "dfn", "div", "dl", "dt", "em", "fieldset", "font", "h1",
"h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6", "hr", "i", "img", "ins", "kbd", "li",
"ol", "p", "pre", "q", "samp", "small", "span", "strong", "sub",
"sup", "table", "tbody", "td", "tfoot", "th", "thead", "tr", "tt",
"u", "ul", "var".



These checks were patterned after the checks made by the
DocCheck
doclet available from Sun. Note: Original Sun's DocCheck tool does not exist anymore.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingLeadingAsterisk
[Description]
Checks if the javadoc has

leading asterisks

on each line.


The check does not require asterisks on the first line, nor on the last line
if it is blank. All other lines in a Javadoc should start with *,
including blank lines and code blocks.
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
