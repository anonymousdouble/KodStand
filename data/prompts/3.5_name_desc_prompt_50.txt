Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
7.3 Where Javadoc is used
At the minimum , Javadoc is present for every `public` class, and every `public` or `protected` member of such a class, with a few exceptions noted below.
 Additional Javadoc content may also be present, as explained in Section 7.3.4, Non-required Javadoc .

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
InvalidJavadocPosition
[Description]
Checks that Javadocs are located at the correct position.
As specified at

Documentation Comment Specification for the Standard Doclet,
Javadocs are recognized only when placed immediately before module, package, class,
interface, constructor, method, or field declarations. Any other position, like
in the body of a method, will be ignored by the javadoc tool and is considered
invalid by this check.
[Rule]
MissingJavadocType
[Description]
Checks for missing Javadoc comments for class, enum, interface, and annotation
interface definitions. The scope to verify is specified using the Scope
class and defaults to Scope.PUBLIC. To verify
another scope, set property scope to one of the
Scope constants.
[Rule]
JavadocVariable
[Description]
Checks that a variable has a Javadoc comment. Ignores serialVersionUID
fields.
[Rule]
JavadocPackage
[Description]
Checks that each Java package has a Javadoc file used for
commenting. By default, it only allows a package-info.java file, but can be
configured to allow a package.html
file.


A violation will be reported if both files exist as this is not
allowed by the Javadoc tool.
[Rule]
MissingJavadocPackage
[Description]
Checks for missing package definition Javadoc comments in package-info.java files.


Rationale: description and other related documentation for a package can be written up
in the package-info.java file and it gets used in the production of the Javadocs.
See
link for more info.


This check specifically only validates package definitions. It will not validate any
methods or interfaces declared in the package-info.java file.
[Rule]
JavadocStyle
[Description]
Validates Javadoc comments to help ensure they are well formed.


The following checks are performed:



Ensures the first sentence ends with proper punctuation
(That is a period, question mark, or exclamation mark, by default).
Note that this check is not applied to inline @return tags,
because the Javadoc tools automatically appends a period to the end of the tag
content.
Javadoc automatically places the first sentence in the
method summary table and index. Without proper punctuation
the Javadoc may be malformed. All items eligible for the
{@inheritDoc} tag are exempt from this
requirement.


Check text for Javadoc statements that do not have any
description. This includes both completely empty Javadoc,
and Javadoc with only tags such as @param and @return.


Check text for incomplete HTML tags. Verifies that HTML
tags have corresponding end tags and issues an "Unclosed
HTML tag found:" error if not. An "Extra HTML tag found:"
error is issued if an end tag is found without a previous
open tag.


Check that a package Javadoc comment is well-formed (as
described above).


Check for allowed HTML tags. The list of allowed HTML tags
is "a", "abbr", "acronym", "address", "area", "b", "bdo", "big",
"blockquote", "br", "caption", "cite", "code", "colgroup", "dd",
"del", "dfn", "div", "dl", "dt", "em", "fieldset", "font", "h1",
"h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6", "hr", "i", "img", "ins", "kbd", "li",
"ol", "p", "pre", "q", "samp", "small", "span", "strong", "sub",
"sup", "table", "tbody", "td", "tfoot", "th", "thead", "tr", "tt",
"u", "ul", "var".



These checks were patterned after the checks made by the
DocCheck
doclet available from Sun. Note: Original Sun's DocCheck tool does not exist anymore.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingWhitespaceAfterAsterisk
[Description]
Checks that there is at least one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
Although spaces after asterisks are optional in the Javadoc comments, their absence
makes the documentation difficult to read. It is the de facto standard to put at least
one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
[Rule]
SummaryJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that

Javadoc summary sentence does not contain phrases that are not recommended to use.
Summaries that contain only the {@inheritDoc} tag are skipped. Summaries
that contain a non-empty {@code {@return}} are allowed. Check also violate Javadoc that
does not contain first sentence, though with {@code {@return}} a period is not required
as the Javadoc tool adds it.
[Rule]
UnusedImports
[Description]
Checks for unused import statements. An
import statement is considered unused if:



It is not referenced in the file. The algorithm does not support
wild-card imports like import
java.io.*;. Most IDE's provide very sophisticated checks
for imports that handle wild-card imports.


The class imported is from the java.lang
package. For example importing java.lang.String.


The class imported is from the same package.


A static method is imported when used as method reference. In that case,
only the type needs to be imported and that's enough to resolve the method.


Optionally: it is referenced in Javadoc comments. This check
is on by default, but it is considered bad practice to introduce
a compile-time dependency for documentation purposes only.
As an example, the import java.util.List would be
considered referenced with the Javadoc comment
{@link List}. The alternative to avoid introducing a
compile-time dependency would be to write the Javadoc comment as
{@link java.util.List}.



The main limitation of this check is handling the cases where:



An imported type has the same name as a declaration, such as a member variable.


There are two or more static imports with the same method name
(javac can distinguish imports with same name but different parameters, but checkstyle
can not due to
limitation.)
[Rule]
ModifierOrder
[Description]
Checks that the order of modifiers conforms to the suggestions in
the Java
Language specification, ¡ì 8.1.1, 8.3.1, 8.4.3 and

9.4. The correct order is:



public


protected


private


abstract


default


static


sealed


non-sealed


final


transient


volatile


synchronized


native


strictfp



In additional, modifiers are checked to ensure all annotations are
declared before all other modifiers.


Rationale: Code is easier to read if everybody follows a standard.


ATTENTION: We skip

type annotations from validation.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
