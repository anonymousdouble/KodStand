"Optimize for the reader, not the writer","Principles/Optimize for the reader, not the writer","Codebases often have extended lifetimes and more time is spent reading the code than writing it. We explicitly choose to optimize for the experience of our average software engineer reading, maintaining, and debugging code in our codebase rather than the ease of writing said code. For example, when something surprising or unusual is happening in a snippet of code, leaving textual hints for the reader is valuable.",,
Be consistent,Principles/Be consistent,"When the style guide allows multiple options it is preferable to pick one option over mixed usage of multiple options. Using one style consistently throughout a codebase lets engineers focus on other (more important) issues. Consistency also enables better automation because consistent code allows more efficient development and operation of tools that format or refactor code. In many cases, rules that are attributed to “Be Consistent” boil down to “Just pick one and stop worrying about it”; the potential value of allowing flexibility on these points is outweighed by the cost of having people argue over them.",,
Be consistent with Apple SDKs,Principles/Be consistent with Apple SDKs,"Consistency with the way Apple SDKs use Objective-C has value for the same reasons as consistency within our code base. If an Objective-C feature solves a problem that’s an argument for using it. However, sometimes language features and idioms are flawed, or were just designed with assumptions that are not universal. In those cases it is appropriate to constrain or ban language features or idioms.",,
Style rules should pull their weight,Principles/Style rules should pull their weight,"The benefit of a style rule must be large enough to justify asking engineers to remember it. The benefit is measured relative to the codebase we would get without the rule, so a rule against a very harmful practice may still have a small benefit if people are unlikely to do it anyway. This principle mostly explains the rules we don’t have, rather than the rules we do: for example, goto contravenes many of the following principles, but is not discussed due to its extreme rarity.",,

Comments,Comments,"Comments are absolutely vital to keeping our code readable. The following rules describe what you should comment and where. But remember: while comments are important, the best code is self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and variables is much better than using obscure names and then trying to explain them through comments.
Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to read well-written comments than badly written ones.
Comments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper capitalization and punctuation. In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than sentence fragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of code, can sometimes be less formal, but use a consistent style. When writing your comments, write for your audience: the next contributor who will need to understand your code. Be generous—the next one may be you!",,

License boilerplate if necessary. Choose the appropriate boilerplate for the license used by the project.

If you make significant changes to a file with an author line, consider deleting the author line since revision history already provides a more detailed and accurate record of authorship.",,
Declaration Comments,Comments/Declaration Comments,"Every non-trivial interface, public and private, should have an accompanying comment describing its purpose and how it fits into the larger picture.

","Doxygen-style comments are encouraged for interfaces as they are parsed by Xcode to display formatted documentation. There is a wide variety of Doxygen commands; use them consistently within a project.
If you have already described an interface in detail in the comments at the top of your file, feel free to simply state, “See comment at top of file for a complete description”, but be sure to have some sort of comment.
Additionally, each method should have a comment explaining its function, arguments, return value, thread or queue assumptions, and any side effects. Documentation comments should be in the header for public methods, or immediately preceding the method for non-trivial private methods.
Use descriptive form (“Opens the file”) rather than imperative form (“Open the file”) for method and function comments. The comment describes the function; it does not tell the function what to do.
Document the thread usage assumptions the class, properties, or methods make, if any. If an instance of the class can be accessed by multiple threads, take extra care to document the rules and invariants surrounding multithreaded use.
Any sentinel values for properties and ivars, such as `NULL` or `-1` , should be documented in comments.

Where instance variables are pointers to Core Foundation, C++, and other non-Objective-C objects, they should always be declared with strong and weak comments to indicate which pointers are and are not retained.

This helps reduce the likelihood they’ll be called when you’re not expecting it. This includes methods that are being overridden from the parent class.

Avoid Messaging the Current Object Within Initializers and -dealloc,Cocoa and Objective-C Features/Avoid Messaging the Current Object Within Initializers and -dealloc,"Code in initializers and `-dealloc` should avoid invoking instance methods.
Superclass initialization completes before subclass initialization. Until all classes have had a chance to initialize their instance state any method invocation on self may lead to a subclass operating on uninitialized instance state.
A similar issue exists for `-dealloc` , where a method invocation may cause a class to operate on state that has been deallocated.
One case where this is less obvious is property accessors. These can be overridden just like any other selector. Whenever practical, directly assign to and release ivars in initializers and `-dealloc` , rather than rely on accessors.","// GOOD:

BOOL Pitfalls,Cocoa and Objective-C Features/BOOL Pitfalls,"Be careful when converting general integral values to `BOOL` . Avoid comparing directly with `YES` .
`BOOL` in OS X and in 32-bit iOS builds is defined as a signed `char` , so it may have values other than `YES` ( `1` ) and `NO` ( `0` ). Do not cast or convert general integral values directly to `BOOL` .
Common mistakes include casting or converting an array’s size, a pointer value, or the result of a bitwise logic operation to a `BOOL` that could, depending on the value of the last byte of the integer value, still result in a `NO` value. When converting a general integral value to a `BOOL` , use ternary operators to return a `YES` or `NO` value.
You can safely interchange and convert `BOOL` , `_Bool` and `bool` (see C++ Std 4.7.4, 4.12 and C99 Std 6.3.1.2). Use `BOOL` in Objective-C method signatures.
Using logical operators ( `&&` , `||` and `!` ) with `BOOL` is also valid and will return values that can be safely converted to `BOOL` without the need for a ternary operator.","// AVOID:

Delegate Pattern,Cocoa Patterns/Delegate Pattern,"Delegates, target objects, and block pointers should not be retained when doing so would create a retain cycle.
To avoid causing a retain cycle, a delegate or target pointer should be released as soon as it is clear there will no longer be a need to message the object.
If there is no clear time at which the delegate or target pointer is no longer needed, the pointer should only be retained weakly.
Block pointers cannot be retained weakly. To avoid causing retain cycles in the client code, block pointers should be used for callbacks only where they can be explicitly released after they have been called or once they are no longer needed. Otherwise, callbacks should be done via weak delegate or target pointers.",,
