Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4 Formatting
Terminology Note: 
 block-like construct refers to the body of a class, method or constructor. Note that, by Section 4.8.3.1 on array initializers , any array initializer may optionally be treated as if it were a block-like construct.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
RightCurly
[Description]
Checks the placement of right curly braces ('}') for code blocks.
This check supports if-else, try-catch-finally blocks, switch statements, switch cases,
while-loops, for-loops, method definitions, class definitions, constructor definitions,
instance, static initialization blocks, annotation definitions and enum definitions.
For right curly brace of expression blocks of arrays, lambdas and class instances
please follow issue
#5945.
For right curly brace of enum constant please follow issue
#7519.
[Rule]
AvoidNestedBlocks
[Description]
Finds nested blocks (blocks that are used freely in the code).


Rationale: Nested blocks are often leftovers from the
debugging process, they confuse the reader.


For example, this check finds the obsolete braces in



public void guessTheOutput()
{
int whichIsWhich = 0;
{
whichIsWhich = 2;
}
System.out.println("value = " + whichIsWhich);
}

and debugging / refactoring leftovers such as


// if (conditionThatIsNotUsedAnyLonger)
{
System.out.println("unconditional");
}


A case in a switch statement does not implicitly form a block.
Thus, to be able to introduce local variables that have case
scope it is necessary to open a nested block. This is
supported, set the allowInSwitchCase property to true and
include all statements of the case in the block.
[Rule]
AvoidDoubleBraceInitialization
[Description]
Detects double brace initialization.


Rationale: Double brace initialization (set of

Instance Initializers in class body) may look cool,
but it is considered as anti-pattern and should be avoided.
This is also can lead to a hard-to-detect memory leak, if the anonymous class instance is
returned outside and other object(s) hold reference to it.
Created anonymous class is not static, it holds an implicit reference to the outer class
instance.
See this

blog post and

article for more details.
Check ignores any comments and semicolons in class body.
[Rule]
EmptyBlock
[Description]
Checks for empty blocks. This check does not validate sequential blocks.
Sequential blocks won't be checked. Also, no violations for fallthrough:


switch (a) {
case 1:                          // no violation
case 2:                          // no violation
case 3: someMethod(); { }        // no violation
default: break;
}


NOTE: This check processes LITERAL_CASE and LITERAL_DEFAULT separately.
Verification empty block is done for single nearest {@code case} or {@code default}.
[Rule]
AvoidInlineConditionals
[Description]
Detects inline conditionals. Here is one example of an inline conditional:



String a = getParameter("a");
String b = (a==null || a.length()<1) ? null : a.substring(1);


Rationale: Some developers find inline conditionals hard to read, so
their employer's coding standards forbid them.
[Rule]
WhitespaceAround
[Description]
Checks that a token is surrounded by whitespace. Empty constructor,
method, class, enum, interface, loop bodies (blocks), lambdas of the form


public MyClass() {}      // empty constructor
public void func() {}    // empty method
public interface Foo {} // empty interface
public class Foo {} // empty class
public enum Foo {} // empty enum
MyClass c = new MyClass() {}; // empty anonymous class
while (i = 1) {} // empty while loop
for (int i = 1; i > 1; i++) {} // empty for loop
do {} while (i = 1); // empty do-while loop
Runnable noop = () -> {}; // empty lambda
public @interface Beta {} // empty annotation type


may optionally be exempted from the policy using the
allowEmptyMethods, allowEmptyConstructors,
allowEmptyTypes, allowEmptyLoops,
allowEmptyLambdas and allowEmptyCatches
properties.

This check does not flag as violation double brace initialization like:



new Properties() {{
setProperty("key", "value");
}};


Parameter allowEmptyCatches allows to suppress violations when token
list contains SLIST to check if beginning of block is surrounded by
whitespace and catch block is empty, for example:



try {
k = 5 / i;
} catch (ArithmeticException ex) {}



With this property turned off, this raises violation because the beginning of the
catch block (left curly bracket) is not separated from the end of the catch
block (right curly bracket).
[Rule]
MethodLength
[Description]
Checks for long methods and constructors.


Rationale: If a method becomes very long it is hard to
understand. Therefore, long methods should usually be refactored into
several individual methods that focus on a specific task.
[Rule]
FinalParameters
[Description]
Checks that parameters for methods, constructors, catch and for-each blocks are
final. Interface, abstract, and native methods are not checked: the final
keyword does not make sense for interface, abstract, and native method
parameters as there is no code that could modify the parameter.


Rationale: Changing the value of parameters during the execution of
the method's algorithm can be confusing and should be avoided. A
great way to let the Java compiler prevent this coding style is to
declare parameters final.
[Rule]
FinalClass
[Description]
Ensures that identifies classes that can be effectively declared as final are explicitly
marked as final. The following are different types of classes that can be identified:



Private classes with no declared constructors.


Classes with any modifier, and contains only private constructors.



Classes are skipped if:



Class is Super class of some Anonymous inner class.


Class is extended by another class in the same file.
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>

    </module>"
}
