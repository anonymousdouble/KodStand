Manage dependencies with Closure's goog.require and goog.provide,1 Angular Language Rules/Manage dependencies with Closure's goog.require and goog.provide,"Choose a namespace for your project, and use goog.provide and goog.require.","
goog.provide('hello.about.AboutCtrl');
goog.provide('hello.versions.Versions');
",Why? Google BUILD rules integrate nicely with closure provide/require.
Modules,1 Angular Language Rules/Modules,"Your main application module should be in your root client directory. A module should never be altered other than the one where it is defined.
Modules may either be defined in the same file as their components (this works well for a module that contains exactly one service) or in a separate file for wiring pieces together.
Why? A module should be consistent for anyone that wants to include it as a reusable component. If a module can mean different things depending on which files are included, it is not consistent.",,
"Modules should reference other modules using the Angular Module's ""name"" property","1 Angular Language Rules/Modules should reference other modules using the Angular Module's ""name"" property",For example:,"
// file submodulea.js:
  goog.provide('my.submoduleA');

  my.submoduleA = angular.module('my.submoduleA', []);
  // ...

// file app.js
  goog.require('my.submoduleA');

  Yes: my.application.module = angular.module('hello', [my.submoduleA.name]);
  
      No: my.application.module = angular.module('hello', ['my.submoduleA']);
  ",Why? Using a property of my.submoduleA prevents Closure presubmit failures complaining that the file is required but never used. Using the .name property avoids duplicating strings.
Use a common externs file,1 Angular Language Rules/Use a common externs file,"This maximally allows the JS compiler to enforce type safety in the presence of externally provided types from Angular, and means you don't have to worry about Angular vars being obfuscated in a confusing way.
Note to readers outside Google: the current externs file is located in an internal-to-Google directory, but an example can be found on github here .",,
JSCompiler Flags,1 Angular Language Rules/JSCompiler Flags,"Reminder : According to the JS style guide, customer facing code must be compiled.
Recommended : Use the JSCompiler (the closure compiler that works with js_binary by default) and ANGULAR_COMPILER_FLAGS_FULL from //javascript/angular/build_defs/build_defs for your base flags.
Note - if you are using @export for methods, you will need to add the compiler flag","
""--generate_exports"",
",
JSCompiler Flags,1 Angular Language Rules/JSCompiler Flags,"If you are using @export for properties, you will need to add the flags:","
""--generate_exports"",
""--remove_unused_prototype_props_in_externs=false"",
""--export_local_property_definitions"",
",
Controllers and Scopes,1 Angular Language Rules/Controllers and Scopes,"Controllers are classes. Methods should be defined on MyCtrl.prototype.
Google Angular applications should use the 'controller as' style to export the controller onto the scope. This is fully implemented in Angular 1.2 and can be mimicked in pre-Angular 1.2 builds.
Pre Angular 1.2, this looks like:","
/**
 * Home controller.
 *
 * @param {!angular.Scope} $scope
 * @constructor
 * @ngInject
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl = function($scope) {
  /** @export */
  $scope.homeCtrl = this; // This is a bridge until Angular 1.2 controller-as

  /**
   * @type {string}
   * @export
   */
  this.myColor = 'blue';
};


/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl.prototype.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
",
Controllers and Scopes,1 Angular Language Rules/Controllers and Scopes,And the template:,"
<div ng-controller=""hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl""/>
  <span ng-class=""homeCtrl.myColor"">I'm in a color!</span>
  <span>{{homeCtrl.add(5, 6)}}</span>
</div>
",
Controllers and Scopes,1 Angular Language Rules/Controllers and Scopes,"After Angular 1.2, this looks like:","
/**
 * Home controller.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @ngInject
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl = function() {
  /**
   * @type {string}
   * @export
   */
  this.myColor = 'blue';
};


/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl.prototype.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
",
Controllers and Scopes,1 Angular Language Rules/Controllers and Scopes,"If you are compiling with property renaming, expose properties and methods using the @export annotation. Remember to @export the constructor as well.
And in the template:","
<div ng-controller=""hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl as homeCtrl""/>
  <span ng-class=""homeCtrl.myColor"">I'm in a color!</span>
  <span>{{homeCtrl.add(5, 6)}}</span>
</div>
","Why? Putting methods and properties directly onto the controller, instead of building up a scope object, fits better with the Google Closure class style. Additionally, using 'controller as' makes it obvious which controller you are accessing when multiple controllers apply to an element. Since there is always a '.' in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal inheritance masking primitives."
Directives,1 Angular Language Rules/Directives,All DOM manipulation should be done inside directives. Directives should be kept small and use composition. Files defining directives should goog.provide a static function which returns the directive definition object.,"
goog.provide('hello.pane.paneDirective');

/**
 * Description and usage
 * @return {angular.Directive} Directive definition object.
 */
hello.pane.paneDirective = function() {
  // ...
};
","Exception : DOM manipulation may occur in services for DOM elements disconnected from the rest of the view, e.g. dialogs or keyboard shortcuts."
Services,1 Angular Language Rules/Services,Services registered on the module with `module.service` are classes. Use `module.service` instead of `module.provider` or `module.factory` unless you need to do initialization beyond just creating a new instance of the class.,"
/**
 * @param {!angular.$http} $http The Angular http service.
 * @constructor
 */
hello.request.Request = function($http) {
  /** @type {!angular.$http} */
  this.http_ = $http;
};

hello.request.Request.prototype.get = function() {/*...*/};
",
Services,1 Angular Language Rules/Services,In the module:,"
module.service('request', hello.request.Request);
",
Reserve $ for Angular properties and services,2 Angular Style Rules/Reserve $ for Angular properties and services,"Do not use $ to prepend your own object properties and service identifiers. Consider this style of naming reserved by AngularJS and jQuery.
Yes:","
  $scope.myModel = { value: 'foo' }
  myModule.service('myService', function() { /*...*/ });
  var MyCtrl = function($http) {this.http_ = $http;};
",
Reserve $ for Angular properties and services,2 Angular Style Rules/Reserve $ for Angular properties and services,No:,"
  $scope.$myModel = { value: 'foo' } // BAD
  $scope.myModel = { $value: 'foo' } // BAD
  myModule.service('$myService', function() { ... }); // BAD
  var MyCtrl = function($http) {this.$http_ = $http;}; // BAD
","Why? It's useful to distinguish between Angular / jQuery builtins and things you add yourself. In addition, $ is not an acceptable character for variables names in the JS style guide."
Custom elements,2 Angular Style Rules/Custom elements,"For custom elements (e.g. `<ng-includesrc=""template""></ng-include>` ), IE8 requires special support (html5shiv-like hacks) to enable css styling. Be aware of this restriction in apps targeting old versions of IE.",,
