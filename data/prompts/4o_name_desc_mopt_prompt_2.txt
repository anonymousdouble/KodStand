Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
2.3.2 Special escape sequences
For any character that has a special escape sequence ( `\b` , `\t` , `\n` , `\f` , `\r` , `\"` , `\'` and `\\` ), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. `\012` ) or Unicode (e.g. `\u000a` ) escape.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
AvoidEscapedUnicodeCharacters
[Description]
Restricts using

Unicode escapes (such as \u221e).
It is possible to allow using escapes for

non-printable, control characters.
Also, this check can be configured to allow using escapes
if trail comment is present. By the option it is possible to
allow using escapes if literal contains only them.
[Options]
allowByTailComment, Allow use escapes if trail comment is present.
allowEscapesForControlCharacters, Allow use escapes for non-printable, control characters.
allowIfAllCharactersEscaped, Allow if all characters in literal are escaped.
allowNonPrintableEscapes, Allow use escapes for non-printable, whitespace characters.
[Rule]
FileTabCharacter
[Description]
Checks that there are no tab characters ('\t') in the source code.


Rationale:



Developers should not need to configure the tab width of their
text editors in order to be able to read source code.


From the Apache jakarta coding standards: In a distributed
development environment, when the commit messages get sent
to a mailing list, they are almost impossible to read if you
use tabs.
[Options]
eachLine, Control whether to report on each line containing a tab, or just the first instance.
fileExtensions, Specify the file extensions of the files to process.
[Rule]
AvoidInlineConditionals
[Description]
Detects inline conditionals. Here is one example of an inline conditional:



String a = getParameter("a");
String b = (a==null || a.length()<1) ? null : a.substring(1);


Rationale: Some developers find inline conditionals hard to read, so
their employer's coding standards forbid them.
[Options]
[Rule]
StringLiteralEquality
[Description]
Checks that string literals are not used with == or
!=.
Since == will compare the object references,
not the actual value of the strings,
String.equals() should be used.
More information can be found

in this article.


Rationale: Novice Java programmers often use code like:



if (x == "something")

when they mean


if ("something".equals(x))
[Options]
[Rule]
HideUtilityClassConstructor
[Description]
Makes sure that utility classes (classes that contain only static
methods or fields in their API) do not have a public constructor.


Rationale: Instantiating utility classes does not make sense. Hence,
the constructors should either be private or (if you want to allow
subclassing) protected. A common mistake is forgetting to hide the
default constructor.


If you make the constructor protected you may want to consider the
following constructor implementation technique to disallow
instantiating subclasses:



public class StringUtils // not final to allow subclassing
{
protected StringUtils() {
// prevents calls from subclass
throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

public static int count(char c, String s) {
// ...
}
}
[Options]
[Rule]
MagicNumber
[Description]
Checks that there are no

"magic numbers" where a magic
number is a numeric literal that is not defined as a constant.
By default, -1, 0, 1, and 2 are not considered to be magic numbers.


Constant definition is any variable/field that has 'final' modifier.
It is fine to have one constant defining multiple numeric literals within one expression:



static final int SECONDS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60;
static final double SPECIAL_RATIO = 4.0 / 3.0;
static final double SPECIAL_SUM = 1 + Math.E;
static final double SPECIAL_DIFFERENCE = 4 - Math.PI;
static final Border STANDARD_BORDER = BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(3, 3, 3, 3);
static final Integer ANSWER_TO_THE_ULTIMATE_QUESTION_OF_LIFE = new Integer(42);
[Options]
constantWaiverParentToken, Specify tokens that are allowed in the AST path from the number literal to the enclosing constant definition.
ignoreAnnotation, Ignore magic numbers in annotation declarations.
ignoreAnnotationElementDefaults, Ignore magic numbers in annotation elements defaults.
ignoreFieldDeclaration, Ignore magic numbers in field declarations.
ignoreHashCodeMethod, Ignore magic numbers in hashCode methods.
ignoreNumbers, Specify non-magic numbers.
tokens, tokens to check
[Rule]
TrailingComment
[Description]
The check to ensure that lines with code do not end with comment.
For the case of // comments that means that the only thing
that should precede it is whitespace. It doesn't check comments if
they do not end a line; for example, it accepts the following:
Thread.sleep( 10 /*some comment here*/ ); Format
property is intended to deal with the } // while example.


Rationale: Steve McConnell in Code Complete suggests that
endline comments are a bad practice. An end line comment would be
one that is on the same line as actual code. For example:



a = b + c;      // Some insightful comment
d = e / f;        // Another comment for this line


Quoting Code Complete for the justification:


"The comments have to be aligned so that they do not
interfere with the visual structure of the code. If you don't align
them neatly, they'll make your listing look like it's been through a
washing machine."

"Endline comments tend to be hard to format...It takes
time to align them. Such time is not spent learning more about the
code; it's dedicated solely to the tedious task of pressing the
spacebar or tab key."

"Endline comments are also hard to maintain. If the code
on any line containing an endline comment grows, it bumps the
comment farther out, and all the other endline comments will have to
bumped out to match. Styles that are hard to maintain aren't
maintained...."

"Endline comments also tend to be cryptic. The right side
of the line doesn't offer much room and the desire to keep the
comment on one line means the comment must be short. Work then goes
into making the line as short as possible instead of as clear as
possible. The comment usually ends up as cryptic as
possible...."

"A systemic problem with endline comments is that it's
hard to write a meaningful comment for one line of code. Most
endline comments just repeat the line of code, which hurts more than
it helps."



McConnell's comments on being hard to maintain when the size of the line
changes are even more important in the age of automated
refactorings.
[Options]
format, Specify pattern for strings allowed before the comment.
legalComment, Define pattern for text allowed in trailing comments. This pattern will not be applied to multiline comments.
[Rule]
GenericWhitespace
[Description]
Checks that the whitespace around the Generic tokens (angle brackets)
"<" and ">" are correct to the typical convention.
The convention is not configurable.


Left angle bracket ("<"):


should be preceded with whitespace only in generic methods definitions.
should not be preceded with whitespace when it is preceded method name
or constructor.
should not be preceded with whitespace when following type name.
should not be followed with whitespace in all cases.


Right angle bracket (">"):


should not be preceded with whitespace in all cases.
should be followed with whitespace in almost all cases, except diamond operators
and when preceding a method name, constructor, or record header.
[Options]
[Rule]
CatchParameterName
[Description]
Checks that catch parameter names conform to a specified pattern.


Default pattern has the following characteristic:


allows names beginning with two lowercase letters followed by at least one uppercase
or lowercase letter
allows e abbreviation (suitable for exceptions end errors)
allows ex abbreviation (suitable for exceptions)
allows t abbreviation (suitable for throwables)
prohibits numbered abbreviations like e1 or t2
prohibits one letter prefixes like pException
prohibits two letter abbreviations like ie or ee
prohibits any other characters than letters
[Options]
format, Sets the pattern to match valid identifiers.
[Rule]
InnerAssignment
[Description]
Checks for assignments in subexpressions, such as in
String s = Integer.toString(i = 2);.


Rationale: Except for the loop idioms,
all assignments should occur in their own top-level statement
to increase readability. With inner assignments like the one given above, it is difficult
to see all places where a variable is set.


Note: Check allows usage of the popular assignments in loops:



String line;
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { // OK
// process the line
}

for (;(line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null;) { // OK
// process the line
}

do {
// process the line
}
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null); // OK


Assignment inside a condition is not a problem here, as the assignment is surrounded by
an extra pair of parentheses. The comparison is != null and there is no
chance that intention was to write line == reader.readLine().
[Options]
