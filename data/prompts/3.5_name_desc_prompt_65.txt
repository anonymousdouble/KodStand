Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.8.4.1 Indentation
As with any other block, the contents of a switch block are indented +2.
 After a switch label, there is a line break, and the indentation level is increased +2, exactly as if a block were being opened. The following switch label returns to the previous indentation level, as if a block had been closed.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Rule]
AvoidNestedBlocks
[Description]
Finds nested blocks (blocks that are used freely in the code).


Rationale: Nested blocks are often leftovers from the
debugging process, they confuse the reader.


For example, this check finds the obsolete braces in



public void guessTheOutput()
{
int whichIsWhich = 0;
{
whichIsWhich = 2;
}
System.out.println("value = " + whichIsWhich);
}

and debugging / refactoring leftovers such as


// if (conditionThatIsNotUsedAnyLonger)
{
System.out.println("unconditional");
}


A case in a switch statement does not implicitly form a block.
Thus, to be able to introduce local variables that have case
scope it is necessary to open a nested block. This is
supported, set the allowInSwitchCase property to true and
include all statements of the case in the block.
[Rule]
CommentsIndentation
[Description]
Controls the indentation between comments and surrounding code.
Comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code.
Detailed info about such convention can be found

here
[Rule]
EmptyBlock
[Description]
Checks for empty blocks. This check does not validate sequential blocks.
Sequential blocks won't be checked. Also, no violations for fallthrough:


switch (a) {
case 1:                          // no violation
case 2:                          // no violation
case 3: someMethod(); { }        // no violation
default: break;
}


NOTE: This check processes LITERAL_CASE and LITERAL_DEFAULT separately.
Verification empty block is done for single nearest {@code case} or {@code default}.
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Rule]
RightCurly
[Description]
Checks the placement of right curly braces ('}') for code blocks.
This check supports if-else, try-catch-finally blocks, switch statements, switch cases,
while-loops, for-loops, method definitions, class definitions, constructor definitions,
instance, static initialization blocks, annotation definitions and enum definitions.
For right curly brace of expression blocks of arrays, lambdas and class instances
please follow issue
#5945.
For right curly brace of enum constant please follow issue
#7519.
[Rule]
NoWhitespaceBeforeCaseDefaultColon
[Description]
Checks that there is no whitespace before the colon in a switch block.
[Rule]
LeftCurly
[Description]
Checks for the placement of left curly braces
('{') for code blocks.
[Rule]
DefaultComesLast
[Description]
Check that the default is after all the
cases in a switch statement.


Rationale: Java allows default anywhere
within the switch statement. But it is
more readable if it comes after the last case.
[Rule]
NeedBraces
[Description]
Checks for braces around code blocks.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
