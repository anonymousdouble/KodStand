Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.6.1 Vertical Whitespace
A single blank line always appears:
 Between consecutive members or initializers of a class: fields, constructors, methods, nested classes, static initializers, and instance initializers. 
 Exception: A blank line between two consecutive fields (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to create logical groupings of fields. 
 Exception: Blank lines between enum constants are covered in Section 4.8.1 . 
 As required by other sections of this document (such as Section 3, Source file structure , and Section 3.3, Import statements ).
 A single blank line may also appear anywhere it improves readability, for example between statements to organize the code into logical subsections. A blank line before the first member or initializer, or after the last member or initializer of the class, is neither encouraged nor discouraged.
 Multiple consecutive blank lines are permitted, but never required (or encouraged).

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
WhitespaceAround
[Description]
Checks that a token is surrounded by whitespace. Empty constructor,
method, class, enum, interface, loop bodies (blocks), lambdas of the form


public MyClass() {}      // empty constructor
public void func() {}    // empty method
public interface Foo {} // empty interface
public class Foo {} // empty class
public enum Foo {} // empty enum
MyClass c = new MyClass() {}; // empty anonymous class
while (i = 1) {} // empty while loop
for (int i = 1; i > 1; i++) {} // empty for loop
do {} while (i = 1); // empty do-while loop
Runnable noop = () -> {}; // empty lambda
public @interface Beta {} // empty annotation type


may optionally be exempted from the policy using the
allowEmptyMethods, allowEmptyConstructors,
allowEmptyTypes, allowEmptyLoops,
allowEmptyLambdas and allowEmptyCatches
properties.

This check does not flag as violation double brace initialization like:



new Properties() {{
setProperty("key", "value");
}};


Parameter allowEmptyCatches allows to suppress violations when token
list contains SLIST to check if beginning of block is surrounded by
whitespace and catch block is empty, for example:



try {
k = 5 / i;
} catch (ArithmeticException ex) {}



With this property turned off, this raises violation because the beginning of the
catch block (left curly bracket) is not separated from the end of the catch
block (right curly bracket).
[Rule]
SingleSpaceSeparator
[Description]
Checks that non-whitespace characters are separated by no more than one
whitespace. Separating characters by tabs or multiple spaces will be
reported. Currently, the check doesn't permit horizontal alignment. To inspect
whitespaces before and after comments, set the property
validateComments to true.


Setting validateComments to false will ignore cases like:



int i;  // Multiple whitespaces before comment tokens will be ignored.
private void foo(int  /* whitespaces before and after block-comments will be
ignored */  i) {


Sometimes, users like to space similar items on different lines to the same
column position for easier reading. This feature isn't supported by this
check, so both braces in the following case will be reported as violations.



public long toNanos(long d)  { return d;             } // 2 violations
public long toMicros(long d) { return d / (C1 / C0); }
[Rule]
EmptyLineSeparator
[Description]
Checks for empty line separators before package, all import declarations,
fields, constructors, methods, nested classes,
static initializers and instance initializers.


Checks for empty line separators before not only statements but
implementation and documentation comments and blocks as well.


ATTENTION: empty line separator is required between token siblings,
not after line where token is found.
If token does not have a sibling of the same type, then empty line
is required at its end (for example for CLASS_DEF it is after '}').
Also, trailing comments are skipped.
[Rule]
GenericWhitespace
[Description]
Checks that the whitespace around the Generic tokens (angle brackets)
"<" and ">" are correct to the typical convention.
The convention is not configurable.


Left angle bracket ("<"):


should be preceded with whitespace only in generic methods definitions.
should not be preceded with whitespace when it is preceded method name
or constructor.
should not be preceded with whitespace when following type name.
should not be followed with whitespace in all cases.


Right angle bracket (">"):


should not be preceded with whitespace in all cases.
should be followed with whitespace in almost all cases, except diamond operators
and when preceding a method name, constructor, or record header.
[Rule]
NoWhitespaceBefore
[Description]
Checks that there is no whitespace before a token. More
specifically, it checks that it is not preceded with whitespace, or
(if linebreaks are allowed) all characters on the line before are
whitespace. To allow linebreaks before a token, set property
allowLineBreaks to true. No check occurs
before semicolons in empty for loop initializers or conditions.
[Rule]
JavadocMissingWhitespaceAfterAsterisk
[Description]
Checks that there is at least one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
Although spaces after asterisks are optional in the Javadoc comments, their absence
makes the documentation difficult to read. It is the de facto standard to put at least
one whitespace after the leading asterisk.
[Rule]
JavadocParagraph
[Description]
Checks the Javadoc paragraph.


Checks that:



There is one blank line between each of two paragraphs.


Each paragraph but the first has <p> immediately before the first word, with
no space after.
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Rule]
LineLength
[Description]
Checks for long lines.


Rationale: Long lines are hard to read in printouts or if developers
have limited screen space for the source code, e.g. if the IDE
displays additional information like project tree, class hierarchy,
etc.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_n' value='value_n'/>
    </module>
    ...
    <module name='rule_name_x'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
