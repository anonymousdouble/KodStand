Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
3.3.2 No line-wrapping
Import statements are not line-wrapped . The column limit (Section 4.4, Column limit: 100 ) does not apply to import statements.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
NoLineWrap
[Description]
Checks that chosen statements are not line-wrapped. By default, this
Check restricts wrapping import and package statements, but it's possible to check
any statement.
[Options]
tokens, tokens to check
[Rule]
RedundantImport
[Description]
Checks for redundant import statements. An import statement is
considered redundant if:



It is a duplicate of another import. This is, when a class is
imported more than once.


The class non-statically imported is from the java.lang
package, e.g. importing java.lang.String.


The class non-statically imported is from the same package as the current package.
[Options]
[Rule]
CustomImportOrder
[Description]
Checks that the groups of import declarations appear in the order specified
by the user. If there is an import but its group is not specified in the
configuration such an import should be placed at the end of the import list.
[Options]
customImportOrderRules, Specify ordered list of import groups.
separateLineBetweenGroups, Force empty line separator between import groups.
sortImportsInGroupAlphabetically, Force grouping alphabetically, in ASCII sort order.
specialImportsRegExp, Specify RegExp for SPECIAL_IMPORTS group imports.
standardPackageRegExp, Specify RegExp for STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE group imports.
thirdPartyPackageRegExp, Specify RegExp for THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE group imports.
[Rule]
AvoidStaticImport
[Description]
Checks that there are no static import statements.


Rationale: Importing static members can lead to naming
conflicts between class' members. It may lead to poor code
readability since it may no longer be clear what class a
member resides in (without looking at the import statement).
[Options]
excludes, Control whether to allow for certain classes via a star notation to be excluded such as java.lang.Math.* or specific static members to be excluded like java.lang.System.out for a variable or java.lang.Math.random for a method. See notes section for details.
[Rule]
AvoidStarImport
[Description]
Checks that there are no import statements that use the * notation.


Rationale: Importing all classes from a package or static
members from a class leads to tight coupling between packages
or classes and might lead to problems when a new version of a
library introduces name clashes.
[Options]
allowClassImports, Control whether to allow starred class imports like import java.util.*;.
allowStaticMemberImports, Control whether to allow starred static member imports like import static org.junit.Assert.*;.
excludes, Specify packages where starred class imports are allowed and classes where starred static member imports are allowed.
[Rule]
ImportOrder
[Description]
Checks the ordering/grouping of imports. Features are:

groups type/static imports: ensures that groups of imports come in a
specific order (e.g., java. comes first, javax. comes second,
then everything else)
adds a separation between type import groups : ensures that a blank
line sit between each group
type/static import groups aren't separated internally: ensures that
each group aren't separated internally by blank line or comment
sorts type/static imports inside each group: ensures that imports
within each group are in lexicographic order

sorts according to case: ensures that the comparison
between imports is case-sensitive, in
ASCII sort order


arrange static imports: ensures the relative order between
type imports and static imports (see
ImportOrderOption)
[Options]
caseSensitive, Control whether string comparison should be case-sensitive or not. Case-sensitive sorting is in ASCII sort order. It affects both type imports and static imports.
groups, Specify list of type import groups. Every group identified either by a common prefix string, or by a regular expression enclosed in forward slashes (e.g. /regexp/). All type imports, which does not match any group, falls into an additional group, located at the end. Thus, the empty list of type groups (the default value) means one group for all type imports.
option, Specify policy on the relative order between type imports and static imports.
ordered, Control whether type imports within each group should be sorted. It doesn't affect sorting for static imports.
separated, Control whether type import groups should be separated by, at least, one blank line or comment and aren't separated internally. It doesn't affect separations for static imports.
separatedStaticGroups, Control whether static import groups should be separated by, at least, one blank line or comment and aren't separated internally. This property has effect only when the property option is set to top or bottom and when property staticGroups is enabled.
sortStaticImportsAlphabetically, Control whether static imports located at top or bottom are sorted within the group.
staticGroups, Specify list of static import groups. Every group identified either by a common prefix string, or by a regular expression enclosed in forward slashes (e.g. /regexp/). All static imports, which does not match any group, fall into an additional group, located at the end. Thus, the empty list of static groups (the default value) means one group for all static imports. This property has effect only when the property option is set to top or bottom.
useContainerOrderingForStatic, Control whether to use container ordering (Eclipse IDE term) for static imports or not.
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Options]
treatTryResourcesAsStatement, Enable resources processing.
[Rule]
UnusedImports
[Description]
Checks for unused import statements. An
import statement is considered unused if:



It is not referenced in the file. The algorithm does not support
wild-card imports like import
java.io.*;. Most IDE's provide very sophisticated checks
for imports that handle wild-card imports.


The class imported is from the java.lang
package. For example importing java.lang.String.


The class imported is from the same package.


A static method is imported when used as method reference. In that case,
only the type needs to be imported and that's enough to resolve the method.


Optionally: it is referenced in Javadoc comments. This check
is on by default, but it is considered bad practice to introduce
a compile-time dependency for documentation purposes only.
As an example, the import java.util.List would be
considered referenced with the Javadoc comment
{@link List}. The alternative to avoid introducing a
compile-time dependency would be to write the Javadoc comment as
{@link java.util.List}.



The main limitation of this check is handling the cases where:



An imported type has the same name as a declaration, such as a member variable.


There are two or more static imports with the same method name
(javac can distinguish imports with same name but different parameters, but checkstyle
can not due to
limitation.)
[Options]
processJavadoc, Control whether to process Javadoc comments.
[Rule]
MultipleVariableDeclarations
[Description]
Checks that each variable declaration is in its own statement and on
its own line.


Rationale:

the Java code conventions chapter 6.1 recommends that
declarations should be one per line/statement.
[Options]
[Rule]
NoCodeInFile
[Description]
Checks whether file contains code.
Java compiler is not raising errors on files with no code or all commented out.
Files which are considered to have no code:



File with no text


File with single-line comment(s)


File with a multi line comment(s).
[Options]

Response Format Should be a json object:
