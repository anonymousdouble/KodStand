Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.5.1 Where to break
The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a higher syntactic level . Also:
 When a line is broken at a non-assignment operator the break comes before the symbol. (Note that this is not the same practice used in Google style for other languages, such as C++ and JavaScript.) 
 This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols: 
 the dot separator ( `.` ) 
 the two colons of a method reference ( `::` ) 
 an ampersand in a type bound ( `<TextendsFoo&Bar>` ) 
 a pipe in a catch block ( `catch(FooException|BarExceptione)` ). 
 When a line is broken at an assignment operator the break typically comes after the symbol, but either way is acceptable. 
 This also applies to the "assignment-operator-like" colon in an enhanced `for` ("foreach") statement. 
 A method or constructor name stays attached to the open parenthesis ( `(` ) that follows it. 
 A comma ( `,` ) stays attached to the token that precedes it. 
 A line is never broken adjacent to the arrow in a lambda, except that a break may come immediately after the arrow if the body of the lambda consists of a single unbraced expression. Examples:
 MyLambda<String, Long, Object> lambda =
  (String label, Long value, Object obj) -> {
  ...
  };
 

 Predicate<String> predicate = str ->
  longExpressionInvolving(str);
 

 Note: The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear code, not necessarily code that fits in the smallest number of lines.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Rule]
OperatorWrap
[Description]
Checks the policy on how to wrap lines on operators.
[Rule]
InnerAssignment
[Description]
Checks for assignments in subexpressions, such as in
String s = Integer.toString(i = 2);.


Rationale: Except for the loop idioms,
all assignments should occur in their own top-level statement
to increase readability. With inner assignments like the one given above, it is difficult
to see all places where a variable is set.


Note: Check allows usage of the popular assignments in loops:



String line;
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { // OK
// process the line
}

for (;(line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null;) { // OK
// process the line
}

do {
// process the line
}
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null); // OK


Assignment inside a condition is not a problem here, as the assignment is surrounded by
an extra pair of parentheses. The comparison is != null and there is no
chance that intention was to write line == reader.readLine().
[Rule]
LineLength
[Description]
Checks for long lines.


Rationale: Long lines are hard to read in printouts or if developers
have limited screen space for the source code, e.g. if the IDE
displays additional information like project tree, class hierarchy,
etc.
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Rule]
GenericWhitespace
[Description]
Checks that the whitespace around the Generic tokens (angle brackets)
"<" and ">" are correct to the typical convention.
The convention is not configurable.


Left angle bracket ("<"):


should be preceded with whitespace only in generic methods definitions.
should not be preceded with whitespace when it is preceded method name
or constructor.
should not be preceded with whitespace when following type name.
should not be followed with whitespace in all cases.


Right angle bracket (">"):


should not be preceded with whitespace in all cases.
should be followed with whitespace in almost all cases, except diamond operators
and when preceding a method name, constructor, or record header.
[Rule]
RightCurly
[Description]
Checks the placement of right curly braces ('}') for code blocks.
This check supports if-else, try-catch-finally blocks, switch statements, switch cases,
while-loops, for-loops, method definitions, class definitions, constructor definitions,
instance, static initialization blocks, annotation definitions and enum definitions.
For right curly brace of expression blocks of arrays, lambdas and class instances
please follow issue
#5945.
For right curly brace of enum constant please follow issue
#7519.
[Rule]
TrailingComment
[Description]
The check to ensure that lines with code do not end with comment.
For the case of // comments that means that the only thing
that should precede it is whitespace. It doesn't check comments if
they do not end a line; for example, it accepts the following:
Thread.sleep( 10 /*some comment here*/ ); Format
property is intended to deal with the } // while example.


Rationale: Steve McConnell in Code Complete suggests that
endline comments are a bad practice. An end line comment would be
one that is on the same line as actual code. For example:



a = b + c;      // Some insightful comment
d = e / f;        // Another comment for this line


Quoting Code Complete for the justification:


"The comments have to be aligned so that they do not
interfere with the visual structure of the code. If you don't align
them neatly, they'll make your listing look like it's been through a
washing machine."

"Endline comments tend to be hard to format...It takes
time to align them. Such time is not spent learning more about the
code; it's dedicated solely to the tedious task of pressing the
spacebar or tab key."

"Endline comments are also hard to maintain. If the code
on any line containing an endline comment grows, it bumps the
comment farther out, and all the other endline comments will have to
bumped out to match. Styles that are hard to maintain aren't
maintained...."

"Endline comments also tend to be cryptic. The right side
of the line doesn't offer much room and the desire to keep the
comment on one line means the comment must be short. Work then goes
into making the line as short as possible instead of as clear as
possible. The comment usually ends up as cryptic as
possible...."

"A systemic problem with endline comments is that it's
hard to write a meaningful comment for one line of code. Most
endline comments just repeat the line of code, which hurts more than
it helps."



McConnell's comments on being hard to maintain when the size of the line
changes are even more important in the age of automated
refactorings.
[Rule]
MethodParamPad
[Description]
Checks the padding between the identifier of a method definition,
constructor definition, method call, or constructor invocation; and
the left parenthesis of the parameter list. That is, if the
identifier and left parenthesis are on the same line, checks whether
a space is required immediately after the identifier or such a space
is forbidden. If they are not on the same line, reports a violation,
unless configured to allow line breaks. To allow linebreaks after
the identifier, set property allowLineBreaks to
true.
[Rule]
NoLineWrap
[Description]
Checks that chosen statements are not line-wrapped. By default, this
Check restricts wrapping import and package statements, but it's possible to check
any statement.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
