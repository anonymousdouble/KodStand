The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says, “Readability counts”.\nA style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.\nHowever, know when to be inconsistent – sometimes style guide recommendations just aren’t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don’t hesitate to ask!\nIn particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP!\nSome other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:\nWhen applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP. \nTo be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons) – although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else’s mess (in true XP style). \nBecause the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code. \nWhen the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of Python that don’t support the feature recommended by the style guide."

                "description": "The naming conventions of Python’s library are a bit of a mess, so we’ll never get this completely consistent – nevertheless, here are the currently recommended naming standards. New modules and packages (including third party frameworks) should be written to these standards, but where an existing library has a different style, internal consistency is preferred.\nOverriding Principle \nNames that are visible to the user as public parts of the API should follow conventions that reflect usage rather than implementation.\nDescriptive: Naming Styles \nThere are a lot of different naming styles. It helps to be able to recognize what naming style is being used, independently from what they are used for. \nThe following naming styles are commonly distinguished: \n`b` (single lowercase letter) \n`B` (single uppercase letter) \n`lowercase` \n`lower_case_with_underscores` \n`UPPERCASE` \n`UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` \n`CapitalizedWords` (or CapWords, or CamelCase – so named because of the bumpy look of its letters [4] ). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps. Note: When using acronyms in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the acronym. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError. \n`mixedCase` (differs from CapitalizedWords by initial lowercase character!) \n`Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores` (ugly!) \nThere’s also the style of using a short unique prefix to group related names together. This is not used much in Python, but it is mentioned for completeness. For example, the `os.stat()` function returns a tuple whose items traditionally have names like `st_mode` , `st_size` , `st_mtime` and so on. (This is done to emphasize the correspondence with the fields of the POSIX system call struct, which helps programmers familiar with that.) \nThe X11 library uses a leading X for all its public functions. In Python, this style is generally deemed unnecessary because attribute and method names are prefixed with an object, and function names are prefixed with a module name. \nIn addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing underscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any case convention): \n`_single_leading_underscore` : weak “internal use” indicator. E.g. `fromMimport*` does not import objects whose names start with an underscore. \n`single_trailing_underscore_` : used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword, e.g. :",
                "example": "tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')\n",
                "appendix": "`__double_leading_underscore` : when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, `__boo` becomes `_FooBar__boo` ; see below). \n`__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__` : “magic” objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. `__init__` , `__import__` or `__file__` . Never invent such names; only use them as documented."
            },
            {
                "description": "Prescriptive: Naming Conventions \nNames to Avoid \nNever use the characters ‘l’ (lowercase letter el), ‘O’ (uppercase letter oh), or ‘I’ (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names. \nIn some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted to use ‘l’, use ‘L’ instead. \nASCII Compatibility \nIdentifiers used in the standard library must be ASCII compatible as described in the policy section of PEP 3131 . \nPackage and Module Names \nModules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged. \nWhen an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore (e.g. `_socket` ). \nClass Names \nClass names should normally use the CapWords convention. \nThe naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable. \nNote that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords convention used only for exception names and builtin constants. \nType Variable Names \nNames of type variables introduced in PEP 484 should normally use CapWords preferring short names: `T` , `AnyStr` , `Num` . It is recommended to add suffixes `_co` or `_contra` to the variables used to declare covariant or contravariant behavior correspondingly:",
                "example": "from typing import TypeVar\n\nVT_co = TypeVar('VT_co', covariant=True)\nKT_contra = TypeVar('KT_contra', contravariant=True)\n",
                "appendix": "Exception Names \nBecause exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention applies here. However, you should use the suffix “Error” on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error). \nGlobal Variable Names \n(Let’s hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module only.) The conventions are about the same as those for functions. \nModules that are designed for use via `fromMimport*` should use the `__all__` mechanism to prevent exporting globals, or use the older convention of prefixing such globals with an underscore (which you might want to do to indicate these globals are “module non-public”). \nFunction and Variable Names \nFunction names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. \nVariable names follow the same convention as function names. \nmixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility. \nFunction and Method Arguments \nAlways use `self` for the first argument to instance methods. \nAlways use `cls` for the first argument to class methods. \nIf a function argument’s name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus `class_` is better than `clss` . (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.) \nMethod Names and Instance Variables \nUse the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. \nUse one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables. \nTo avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python’s name mangling rules. \nPython mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an attribute named `__a` , it cannot be accessed by `Foo.__a` . (An insistent user could still gain access by calling `Foo._Foo__a` .) Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed. \nNote: there is some controversy about the use of __names (see below). \nConstants \nConstants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include `MAX_OVERFLOW` and `TOTAL` . \nDesigning for Inheritance \nAlways decide whether a class’s methods and instance variables (collectively: “attributes”) should be public or non-public. If in doubt, choose non-public; it’s easier to make it public later than to make a public attribute non-public. \nPublic attributes are those that you expect unrelated clients of your class to use, with your commitment to avoid backwards incompatible changes. Non-public attributes are those that are not intended to be used by third parties; you make no guarantees that non-public attributes won’t change or even be removed. \nWe don’t use the term “private” here, since no attribute is really private in Python (without a generally unnecessary amount of work). \nAnother category of attributes are those that are part of the “subclass API” (often called “protected” in other languages). Some classes are designed to be inherited from, either to extend or modify aspects of the class’s behavior. When designing such a class, take care to make explicit decisions about which attributes are public, which are part of the subclass API, and which are truly only to be used by your base class. \nWith this in mind, here are the Pythonic guidelines: \nPublic attributes should have no leading underscores. \nIf your public attribute name collides with a reserved keyword, append a single trailing underscore to your attribute name. This is preferable to an abbreviation or corrupted spelling. (However, notwithstanding this rule, ‘cls’ is the preferred spelling for any variable or argument which is known to be a class, especially the first argument to a class method.) Note 1: See the argument name recommendation above for class methods. \nFor simple public data attributes, it is best to expose just the attribute name, without complicated accessor/mutator methods. Keep in mind that Python provides an easy path to future enhancement, should you find that a simple data attribute needs to grow functional behavior. In that case, use properties to hide functional implementation behind simple data attribute access syntax. Note 1: Try to keep the functional behavior side-effect free, although side-effects such as caching are generally fine. \nNote 2: Avoid using properties for computationally expensive operations; the attribute notation makes the caller believe that access is (relatively) cheap. \nIf your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes that you do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with double leading underscores and no trailing underscores. This invokes Python’s name mangling algorithm, where the name of the class is mangled into the attribute name. This helps avoid attribute name collisions should subclasses inadvertently contain attributes with the same name. Note 1: Note that only the simple class name is used in the mangled name, so if a subclass chooses both the same class name and attribute name, you can still get name collisions. \nNote 2: Name mangling can make certain uses, such as debugging and `__getattr__()` , less convenient. However the name mangling algorithm is well documented and easy to perform manually. \nNote 3: Not everyone likes name mangling. Try to balance the need to avoid accidental name clashes with potential use by advanced callers.\nPublic and Internal Interfaces \nAny backwards compatibility guarantees apply only to public interfaces. Accordingly, it is important that users be able to clearly distinguish between public and internal interfaces. \nDocumented interfaces are considered public, unless the documentation explicitly declares them to be provisional or internal interfaces exempt from the usual backwards compatibility guarantees. All undocumented interfaces should be assumed to be internal. \nTo better support introspection, modules should explicitly declare the names in their public API using the `__all__` attribute. Setting `__all__` to an empty list indicates that the module has no public API. \nEven with `__all__` set appropriately, internal interfaces (packages, modules, classes, functions, attributes or other names) should still be prefixed with a single leading underscore. \nAn interface is also considered internal if any containing namespace (package, module or class) is considered internal. \nImported names should always be considered an implementation detail. Other modules must not rely on indirect access to such imported names unless they are an explicitly documented part of the containing module’s API, such as `os.path` or a package’s `__init__` module that exposes functionality from submodules."

For example, do not rely on CPython’s efficient implementation of in-place string concatenation for statements in the form `a+=b` or `a=a+b` . This optimization is fragile even in CPython (it only works for some types) and isn’t present at all in implementations that don’t use refcounting. In performance sensitive parts of the library, the `''.join()` form should be used instead. This will ensure that concatenation occurs in linear time across various implementations. \nComparisons to singletons like None should always be done with `is` or `isnot` , never the equality operators. Also, beware of writing `ifx` when you really mean `ifxisnotNone` – e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to None was set to some other value. The other value might have a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean context! \nUse `isnot` operator rather than `not...is` .

To minimize the effort involved, the `functools.total_ordering()` decorator provides a tool to generate missing comparison methods. \nPEP 207 indicates that reflexivity rules are assumed by Python. Thus, the interpreter may swap `y>x` with `x<y` , `y>=x` with `x<=y` , and may swap the arguments of `x==y` and `x!=y` . The `sort()` and `min()` operations are guaranteed to use the `<` operator and the `max()` function uses the `>` operator. However, it is best to implement all six operations so that confusion doesn’t arise in other contexts. \nAlways use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier:",

Direct inheritance from `BaseException` is reserved for exceptions where catching them is almost always the wrong thing to do. Design exception hierarchies based on the distinctions that code catching the exceptions is likely to need, rather than the locations where the exceptions are raised. Aim to answer the question “What went wrong?” programmatically, rather than only stating that “A problem occurred” (see PEP 3151 for an example of this lesson being learned for the builtin exception hierarchy) \nClass naming conventions apply here, although you should add the suffix “Error” to your exception classes if the exception is an error. Non-error exceptions that are used for non-local flow control or other forms of signaling need no special suffix. \nUse exception chaining appropriately. `raiseXfromY` should be used to indicate explicit replacement without losing the original traceback. When deliberately replacing an inner exception (using `raiseXfromNone` ), ensure that relevant details are transferred to the new exception (such as preserving the attribute name when converting KeyError to AttributeError, or embedding the text of the original exception in the new exception message). \nWhen catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever possible instead of using a bare `except:` clause:",
