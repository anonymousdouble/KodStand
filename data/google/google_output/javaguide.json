A \"character\" means any Unicode code point.\n        Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped, as explained in\n        Section 4.5, Line-wrapping.\n      Each Unicode code point counts as one character, even if its display width is\n        greater or less. For example, if using\n        fullwidth characters,\n        you may choose to wrap the line earlier than where this rule strictly requires.\n      Exceptions:\nLines where obeying the column limit is not possible (for example, a long URL in Javadoc,\n          or a long JSNI method reference).\npackage and\n          import statements (see Sections\n          3.2 Package statement and\n          3.3 Import statements).\n        \nCommand lines in a comment that may be copied-and-pasted into a shell.\nVery long identifiers, on the rare occasions they are called for, are allowed to exceed the\n          column limit. In that case, the valid wrapping for the surrounding code is as produced by\n\n\n          google-java-format.\n        \n",
