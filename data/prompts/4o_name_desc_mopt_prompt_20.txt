Please generate CheckStyle configurations based on the following style convention and CheckStyle rules. Ensure that the output includes only the relevant configurations for the style convention and excludes any unrelated rules.


Style Convention:
4.5 Line-wrapping
Terminology Note: When code that might otherwise legally occupy a single line is divided into multiple lines, this activity is called line-wrapping .
 There is no comprehensive, deterministic formula showing exactly how to line-wrap in every situation. Very often there are several valid ways to line-wrap the same piece of code.
 Note: While the typical reason for line-wrapping is to avoid overflowing the column limit, even code that would in fact fit within the column limit may be line-wrapped at the author's discretion.
 Tip: Extracting a method or local variable may solve the problem without the need to line-wrap.

CheckStyle Rules:
[Rule]
Indentation
[Description]
Checks correct indentation of Java code.


The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.


Basic offset indentation is used for indentation inside code blocks.
For any lines that span more than 1, line wrapping indentation is used for those
lines after the first.
Brace adjustment, case, and throws indentations are all used only if those specific
identifiers start the line. If, for example, a brace is used in the middle of the line,
its indentation will not take effect.
All indentations have an accumulative/recursive effect when they are triggered. If
during a line wrapping, another code block is found and it doesn't end on that same
line, then the subsequent lines afterwards, in that new code block, are increased on
top of the line wrap and any indentations above it.

Example:


if ((condition1 && condition2)
|| (condition3 && condition4)    // line wrap with bigger indentation
||!(condition5 && condition6)) { // line wrap with bigger indentation
field.doSomething()                    // basic offset
.doSomething()                     // line wrap
.doSomething( c -> {               // line wrap
return c.doSome();               // basic offset
});
}
[Options]
arrayInitIndent, Specify how far an array initialization should be indented when on next line.
basicOffset, Specify how far new indentation level should be indented when on the next line.
braceAdjustment, Specify how far a braces should be indented when on the next line.
caseIndent, Specify how far a case label should be indented when on next line.
forceStrictCondition, Force strict indent level in line wrapping case. If value is true, line wrap indent have to be same as lineWrappingIndentation parameter. If value is false, line wrap indent could be bigger on any value user would like.
lineWrappingIndentation, Specify how far continuation line should be indented when line-wrapping is present.
throwsIndent, Specify how far a throws clause should be indented when on next line.
[Rule]
MultipleVariableDeclarations
[Description]
Checks that each variable declaration is in its own statement and on
its own line.


Rationale:

the Java code conventions chapter 6.1 recommends that
declarations should be one per line/statement.
[Options]
[Rule]
LineLength
[Description]
Checks for long lines.


Rationale: Long lines are hard to read in printouts or if developers
have limited screen space for the source code, e.g. if the IDE
displays additional information like project tree, class hierarchy,
etc.
[Options]
fileExtensions, Specify the file extensions of the files to process.
ignorePattern, Specify pattern for lines to ignore.
max, Specify the maximum line length allowed.
[Rule]
JavadocTagContinuationIndentation
[Description]
Checks the indentation of the continuation lines in block tags.
That is whether the
continued description of at clauses should be indented or not. If the text is not properly
indented it throws a violation. A continuation line is when the description starts/spans
past the line with the tag. Default indentation required is at least 4, but this can be
changed with the help of properties below.
[Options]
offset, Specify how many spaces to use for new indentation level.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.
[Rule]
LambdaBodyLength
[Description]
Checks lambda body length.


Rationale: Similar to anonymous inner classes, if lambda body becomes very long
it is hard to understand and to see the flow of the method
where the lambda is defined. Therefore, long lambda body
should usually be extracted to method.
[Options]
max, Specify the maximum number of lines allowed.
[Rule]
TrailingComment
[Description]
The check to ensure that lines with code do not end with comment.
For the case of // comments that means that the only thing
that should precede it is whitespace. It doesn't check comments if
they do not end a line; for example, it accepts the following:
Thread.sleep( 10 /*some comment here*/ ); Format
property is intended to deal with the } // while example.


Rationale: Steve McConnell in Code Complete suggests that
endline comments are a bad practice. An end line comment would be
one that is on the same line as actual code. For example:



a = b + c;      // Some insightful comment
d = e / f;        // Another comment for this line


Quoting Code Complete for the justification:


"The comments have to be aligned so that they do not
interfere with the visual structure of the code. If you don't align
them neatly, they'll make your listing look like it's been through a
washing machine."

"Endline comments tend to be hard to format...It takes
time to align them. Such time is not spent learning more about the
code; it's dedicated solely to the tedious task of pressing the
spacebar or tab key."

"Endline comments are also hard to maintain. If the code
on any line containing an endline comment grows, it bumps the
comment farther out, and all the other endline comments will have to
bumped out to match. Styles that are hard to maintain aren't
maintained...."

"Endline comments also tend to be cryptic. The right side
of the line doesn't offer much room and the desire to keep the
comment on one line means the comment must be short. Work then goes
into making the line as short as possible instead of as clear as
possible. The comment usually ends up as cryptic as
possible...."

"A systemic problem with endline comments is that it's
hard to write a meaningful comment for one line of code. Most
endline comments just repeat the line of code, which hurts more than
it helps."



McConnell's comments on being hard to maintain when the size of the line
changes are even more important in the age of automated
refactorings.
[Options]
format, Specify pattern for strings allowed before the comment.
legalComment, Define pattern for text allowed in trailing comments. This pattern will not be applied to multiline comments.
[Rule]
InnerAssignment
[Description]
Checks for assignments in subexpressions, such as in
String s = Integer.toString(i = 2);.


Rationale: Except for the loop idioms,
all assignments should occur in their own top-level statement
to increase readability. With inner assignments like the one given above, it is difficult
to see all places where a variable is set.


Note: Check allows usage of the popular assignments in loops:



String line;
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) { // OK
// process the line
}

for (;(line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null;) { // OK
// process the line
}

do {
// process the line
}
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null); // OK


Assignment inside a condition is not a problem here, as the assignment is surrounded by
an extra pair of parentheses. The comparison is != null and there is no
chance that intention was to write line == reader.readLine().
[Options]
[Rule]
OneStatementPerLine
[Description]
Checks that there is only one statement per line.


Rationale: It's very difficult to read multiple statements on one line.


In the Java programming language, statements are the fundamental unit of
execution. All statements except blocks are terminated by a semicolon.
Blocks are denoted by open and close curly braces.


OneStatementPerLineCheck checks the following types of statements:
variable declaration statements, empty statements, import statements,
assignment statements, expression statements, increment statements,
object creation statements, 'for loop' statements, 'break' statements,
'continue' statements, 'return' statements, resources statements (optional).
[Options]
treatTryResourcesAsStatement, Enable resources processing.
[Rule]
AvoidInlineConditionals
[Description]
Detects inline conditionals. Here is one example of an inline conditional:



String a = getParameter("a");
String b = (a==null || a.length()<1) ? null : a.substring(1);


Rationale: Some developers find inline conditionals hard to read, so
their employer's coding standards forbid them.
[Options]
[Rule]
SingleLineJavadoc
[Description]
Checks that a Javadoc block can fit in a single-line and doesn't
contain block tags. Javadoc comment that contains at least one block tag
should be formatted in a few lines.
[Options]
ignoreInlineTags, Control whether
inline tags must be ignored.
ignoredTags, Specify
block tags which are ignored by the check.
violateExecutionOnNonTightHtml, Control when to print violations if the Javadoc being examined by this check violates the tight html rules defined at
Tight-HTML Rules.

Response Format Should be a json object:
{
    "Answer":  Respond with either Yes or No to show whether CheckStyle configurations exist for the given style convention,
    "Configuration": If the answer is Yes, provide the configuration. There can be one or multiple CheckStyle rules for the given style convention. The configuration format should be xml format:
    "<module name='rule_name_1'>
        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>

        <property name='id' value='id_value_1'/>
        <property name='name_1' value='value_1'/>
        <property name='name_2' value='value_2'/>
        ...
        <property name='name_m' value='value_m'/>
    </module>"
}
