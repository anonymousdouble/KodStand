It contains some helpful\nhints and cites several useful articles and talks.\nHere are some other considerations and notes.\nUsers see godoc for the package in one page, and any methods exported by types\nsupplied by the package are grouped by their type. Godoc also group constructors\nalong with the types they return. If client code is likely to need two values\nof different type to interact with each other, it may be convenient for the user\nto have them in the same package.\nCode within a package can access unexported identifiers in the package. If you\nhave a few related types whose implementation is tightly coupled, placing them\nin the same package lets you achieve this coupling without polluting the public\nAPI with these details. A good test for this coupling is to imagine a\nhypothetical user of two packages, where the packages cover closely related\ntopics: if the user must import both packages in order to use either in any\nmeaningful way, combining them together is usually the right thing to do. The\nstandard library generally demonstrates this kind of scoping and layering well.\nAll of that being said, putting your entire project in a single package would\nlikely make that package too large. When something is conceptually distinct,\ngiving it its own small package can make it easier to use. The short name of the\npackage as known to clients together with the exported type name work together\nto make a meaningful identifier: e.g. `bytes.Buffer`, `ring.New`. The blog post has more examples.\nGo style is flexible about file size, because maintainers can move code within a\npackage from one file to another without affecting callers. But as a general\nguideline: it is usually not a good idea to have a single file with many\nthousands of lines in it, or having many tiny files. There is no “one type, one\nfile” convention as in some other languages. As a rule of thumb, files should be\nfocused enough that a maintainer can tell which file contains something, and the\nfiles should be small enough that it will be easy to find once there. The\nstandard library often splits large packages to several source files, grouping\nrelated code by file. The source for package `bytes`\nis a good example.\nPackages with long package documentation may choose to dedicate one file called `doc.go`that has the package documentation , a\npackage declaration, and nothing else, but this is not required.\nWithin the Google codebase and in projects using Bazel, directory layout for Go\ncode is different than it is in open source Go projects: you can have multiple `go_library`targets in a single directory. A good reason to give each package\nits own directory is if you expect to open source your project in the future.\nSee also:\nTest double packages"

Functions with\nlarge numbers of arguments are less memorable and more difficult to read at the\ncall-site.\nWhen designing an API, consider splitting a highly configurable function whose\nsignature is growing complex into several simpler ones. These can share an\n(unexported) implementation if necessary.\nWhere a function requires many inputs, consider introducing an option struct for some of the arguments or employing the more advanced variadic options technique. The primary consideration for which strategy to choose should be how\nthe function call looks across all expected use cases.\nThe recommendations below primarily apply to exported APIs, which are held to a\nhigher standard than unexported ones. These techniques may be unnecessary for\nyour use case. Use your judgment, and balance the principles of clarity and least mechanism .\nSee also: Go Tip #24: Use Case-Specific Constructions"

                "description": "Go distinguishes between “test helpers” and “assertion helpers”:\nTest helpers are functions that do setup or cleanup tasks. All failures\nthat occur in test helpers are expected to be failures of the environment\n(not from the code under test) — for example when a test database cannot be\nstarted because there are no more free ports on this machine. For functions\nlike these, calling `t.Helper`is often appropriate to mark them as a test helper . See error handling in test helpers for more\ndetails. \n\n\n\nAssertion helpers are functions that check the correctness of a system\nand fail the test if an expectation is not met. Assertion helpers are not considered idiomatic in Go.\nThe purpose of a test is to report pass/fail conditions of the code under test.\nThe ideal place to fail a test is within the `Test`function itself, as that\nensures that failure messages and the test logic are clear.\nAs your testing code grows, it may become necessary to factor out some\nfunctionality to separate functions. Standard software engineering\nconsiderations still apply, as test code is still code . If the functionality\ndoes not interact with the testing framework, then all of the usual rules apply.\nWhen the common code interacts with the framework, however, some care must be\ntaken to avoid common pitfalls that can lead to uninformative failure messages\nand unmaintainable tests.\nIf many separate test cases require the same validation logic, arrange the test\nin one of the following ways instead of using assertion helpers or complex\nvalidation functions:\nInline the logic (both the validation and the failure) in the `Test`function, even if it is repetitive. This works best in simple cases. \nIf inputs are similar, consider unifying them into a table-driven test while keeping the logic inlined in the loop. This helps to avoid repetition\nwhile keeping the validation and failure in the `Test`. \nIf there are multiple callers who need the same validation function but\ntable tests are not suitable (typically because the inputs are not simple\nenough or the validation is required as part of a sequence of operations),\narrange the validation function so that it returns a value (typically an `error`) rather than taking a `testing.T`parameter and using it to fail the\ntest. Use logic within the `Test`to decide whether to fail, and to provide useful test failures . You can also create test helpers to factor out\ncommon boilerplate setup code.\nThe design outlined in the last point maintains orthogonality. For example, package `cmp`\nis not designed to fail tests, but rather to compare (and to\ndiff) values. It therefore does not need to know about the context in which the\ncomparison was made, since the caller can supply that. If your common testing\ncode provides a `cmp.Transformer`for your data type, that can often be the\nsimplest design. For other validations, consider returning an `error`value.",

For example, a public\nfunction may use a private global variable as a cache, but so long as the\ncaller can’t distinguish cache hits from misses, the function is stateless. \nThe global state does not bleed into things that are external to the\nprogram, like sidecar processes or files on a shared filesystem. \nThere is no expectation of predictable behavior\n( example ).\nNote: \nSidecar processes may not strictly be process-local. They can and often are shared with more\nthan one application process. Moreover, these sidecars often interact with\nexternal distributed systems. \nFurther, the same stateless, idempotent, and local rules in addition to the\nbase considerations above would apply to the code of the sidecar process\nitself!\nAn example of one of these safe situations is \n`packageimage`\nwith its \n`image.RegisterFormat`\nfunction.\nConsider the litmus tests from above applied to a typical decoder, like the one\nfor handling the PNG format:\nMultiple calls to `packageimage`’s APIs that use the registered decoders\n(for example, `image.Decode`) cannot interfere with one another, similarly\nfor tests. The only exception is `image.RegisterFormat`, but that is\nmitigated by the points below. \nIt is extremely unlikely that a user would want to replace a decoder with a test double , as the PNG decoder exemplifies a case in which our codebase’s\npreference for real objects applies. However, a user would be more likely to\nreplace a decoder with a test double if the decoder statefully interacted\nwith operating system resources (for example, the network). \nCollisions in registration are conceivable, though they are probably rare in\npractice. \nThe decoders are stateless, idempotent, and pure."
